{"id": "0-0", "text": "A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named . The Table Talk of Martin Luther , compiled by his notetaker , Mathesius , contains the story of a 12 - year - old boy who may have been severely autistic . Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil , and suggested that he be suffocated , although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report . The earliest well - documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue , as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair 's marriage to gain Blair 's inheritance . The Wild Boy of Aveyron , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation . The New Latin word autismus ( English translation autism ) was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia . He derived it from the Greek word autós ( αὐτός , meaning \" self \" ) , and used it to mean morbid self - admiration , referring to \" autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance \" . A Soviet child psychiatrist , Grunya Sukhareva , described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925 , and in German in 1926 . The word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler 's terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology . Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 . Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities . Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner 's first paper on the subject , notably \" autistic aloneness \" and \" insistence on sameness \" , are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders . It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger . Donald Triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism . He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938 , and was labeled as \" case 1 \" . Triplett was noted for his savant abilities , particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers .", "entities": [{"start": 101, "end": 111, "label": ["30465262"], "title": ["Table_Talk_(Luther)"], "text": "Table Talk"}, {"start": 115, "end": 128, "label": ["7567080"], "title": ["Martin_Luther"], "text": "Martin Luther"}, {"start": 671, "end": 690, "label": ["32777"], "title": ["Victor_of_Aveyron"], "text": "Wild Boy of Aveyron"}, {"start": 695, "end": 706, "label": ["19005888"], "title": ["Feral_child"], "text": "feral child"}, {"start": 777, "end": 787, "label": ["5753955"], "title": ["Jean_Marc_Gaspard_Itard"], "text": "Jean Itard"}, {"start": 912, "end": 921, "label": ["21983"], "title": ["New_Latin"], "text": "New Latin"}, {"start": 985, "end": 990, "label": ["7351032"], "title": ["Swiss_people"], "text": "Swiss"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1017, "label": ["276370"], "title": ["Eugen_Bleuler"], "text": "Eugen Bleuler"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1070, "label": ["27790"], "title": ["Schizophrenia"], "text": "schizophrenia"}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1386, "label": ["51251268"], "title": ["Grunya_Sukhareva"], "text": "Grunya Sukhareva"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1552, "label": ["19389318"], "title": ["Hans_Asperger"], "text": "Hans Asperger"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1586, "label": ["10342296"], "title": ["Vienna_General_Hospital"], "text": "Vienna University Hospital"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1684, "label": ["9014"], "title": ["Developmental_psychology"], "text": "child psychology"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1751, "label": ["37556"], "title": ["Asperger_syndrome"], "text": "Asperger syndrome"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1857, "label": ["637087"], "title": ["Leo_Kanner"], "text": "Leo Kanner"}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1887, "label": ["218873"], "title": ["Johns_Hopkins_Hospital"], "text": "Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, {"start": 2354, "end": 2369, "label": ["53536238"], "title": ["Donald_Triplett"], "text": "Donald Triplett"}]}

By the age of 2 , he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism . He was also interested in creating musical chords . Kanner 's reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia , and child psychiatry 's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant 's response to \" refrigerator mothers \" . Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome . As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism ; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions . Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed , parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child 's autistic behavior is perceived negatively , and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research . It took until 1980 for the DSM - III to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia . In 1987 , the DSM - III - R provided a checklist for diagnosing autism . In May 2013 , the DSM-5 was released , updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders . The grouping of disorders , including PDD - NOS , autism , Asperger syndrome , Rett syndrome , and CDD , has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders . The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction , and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors . The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely . Societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being .", "entities": [{"start": 563, "end": 583, "label": ["1817319"], "title": ["Refrigerator_mother_theory"], "text": "refrigerator mothers"}, {"start": 974, "end": 987, "label": ["2649767"], "title": ["Social_stigma"], "text": "social stigma"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1099, "label": ["2356893"], "title": ["Primary_care_physician"], "text": "primary care physicians"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1123, "label": ["3172179"], "title": ["Medical_specialty"], "text": "medical specialists"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1224, "label": ["8498"], "title": ["Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"], "text": "DSM - III"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1307, "label": ["8498"], "title": ["Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"], "text": "DSM - III - R"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1376, "label": ["11973479"], "title": ["DSM-5"], "text": "DSM-5"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1507, "label": ["694777"], "title": ["Pervasive_developmental_disorder_not_otherwise_specified"], "text": "PDD - NOS"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1536, "label": ["37556"], "title": ["Asperger_syndrome"], "text": "Asperger syndrome"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1552, "label": ["56476"], "title": ["Rett_syndrome"], "text": "Rett syndrome"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1562, "label": ["898648"], "title": ["Childhood_disintegrative_disorder"], "text": "CDD"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 2018, "label": ["11996900"], "title": ["Societal_and_cultural_aspects_of_autism"], "text": "Societal and cultural aspects of autism"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2135, "label": ["1073739"], "title": ["Neurodiversity"], "text": "autism is simply another way of being"}]}

{"id": "2-0", "text": "The history of animation started long before the development of cinematography . Humans have probably attempted to depict motion as far back as the Paleolithic period . Shadow play and the magic lantern offered popular shows with moving images as the result of manipulation by hand and/or some minor mechanics . A 5,200 - year old pottery bowl discovered in Shahr - e Sukhteh , Iran , has five sequential images painted around it that seem to show phases of a goat leaping up to nip at a tree . In 1833 , the phenakistiscope introduced the stroboscopic principle of modern animation , which would also provide the basis for the zoetrope ( 1866 ) , the flip book ( 1868 ) , the praxinoscope ( 1877 ) and cinematography . Charles - Émile Reynaud further developed his projection praxinoscope into the Théâtre Optique with transparent hand - painted colorful pictures in a long perforated strip wound between two spools , patented in December 1888 . From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500.000 visitors at the Musée Grévin in Paris . His Pantomimes Lumineuses series of animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film . Piano music , song , and some dialogue were performed live , while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet . After cinematography became a popular medium , some manufacturers of optical toys adapted small magic lanterns into toy film projectors for short loops of film . By 1902 , they were producing many chromolithography film loops , usually by tracing live - action film footage ( much like the later rotoscoping technique ) . Some early filmmakers , including J. Stuart Blackton , Arthur Melbourne - Cooper , Segundo de Chomón and Edwin S. Porter experimented with stop - motion animation , possibly since around 1899 . Blackton 's The Haunted Hotel ( 1907 ) was the first huge success that baffled audiences with objects apparently moving by themselves and inspired other filmmakers to try the technique . J. Stuart Blackton also experimented with animation drawn on blackboards and some cutout animation in Humorous Phases of Funny Faces ( 1906 ) . In 1908 , Émile Cohl 's Fantasmagorie was released with a white - on - black chalkline look created with negative prints from black ink drawings on white paper . The film largely consists of a stick figure moving about and encountering all kinds of morphing objects , including a wine bottle that transforms into a flower . Inspired by Émile Cohl 's stop - motion film Les allumettes animées [ Animated Matches ] ( 1908 ) , Ladislas Starevich started making his influential puppet animations in 1910 . Winsor McCay 's Little Nemo ( 1911 ) showcased very detailed drawings .", "entities": [{"start": 64, "end": 78, "label": ["195718"], "title": ["Cinematography"], "text": "cinematography"}, {"start": 148, "end": 159, "label": ["22860"], "title": ["Paleolithic"], "text": "Paleolithic"}, {"start": 169, "end": 180, "label": ["1442169"], "title": ["Shadow_play"], "text": "Shadow play"}, {"start": 189, "end": 202, "label": ["20783"], "title": ["Magic_lantern"], "text": "magic lantern"}, {"start": 358, "end": 375, "label": ["3649002"], "title": ["Shahr-e_Sukhteh"], "text": "Shahr - e Sukhteh"}, {"start": 378, "end": 382, "label": ["14653"], "title": ["Iran"], "text": "Iran"}, {"start": 509, "end": 524, "label": ["506291"], "title": ["Phenakistiscope"], "text": "phenakistiscope"}, {"start": 540, "end": 552, "label": ["1055454"], "title": ["Stroboscope"], "text": "stroboscopic"}, {"start": 628, "end": 636, "label": ["34526"], "title": ["Zoetrope"], "text": "zoetrope"}, {"start": 652, "end": 661, "label": ["917175"], "title": ["Flip_book"], "text": "flip book"}, {"start": 677, "end": 689, "label": ["506305"], "title": ["Praxinoscope"], "text": "praxinoscope"}, {"start": 720, "end": 743, "label": ["385718"], "title": ["Émile_Reynaud"], "text": "Charles - Émile Reynaud"}, {"start": 799, "end": 814, "label": ["8329897"], "title": ["Théâtre_Optique"], "text": "Théâtre Optique"}, {"start": 977, "end": 981, "label": ["34653"], "title": ["1900"], "text": "1900"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1068, "label": ["1980771"], "title": ["Musée_Grévin"], "text": "Musée Grévin"}, {"start": 1530, "end": 1534, "label": ["34652"], "title": ["1902"], "text": "1902"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1579, "label": ["714047"], "title": ["Chromolithography"], "text": "chromolithography"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1672, "label": ["340477"], "title": ["Rotoscoping"], "text": "rotoscoping"}, {"start": 1721, "end": 1739, "label": ["330773"], "title": ["J._Stuart_Blackton"], "text": "J.

{"id": "2-1", "text": "His Gertie the Dinosaur ( 1914 ) was also an early example of character development in drawn animation . During the 1910s , the production of animated short films , known as \" cartoons \" , became an industry and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in cinemas . The most successful producer at the time was John Randolph Bray , who , along with animator Earl Hurd , patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade . El Apóstol ( Spanish : \" The Apostle \" ) was a 1917 Argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation , and the world 's first animated feature film . A fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle 's film studio incinerated the only known copy of El Apóstol , and it is now considered a lost film . In 1919 , the silent animated short Feline Follies marked the debut of Felix the Cat , becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity . The earliest extant feature - length animated film is The Adventures of Prince Achmed ( 1926 ) made by director Lotte Reiniger and her collaborators Carl Koch and Berthold Bartosch . The first animation with full sound synchronization ( both music and dialogue ) was a short by Walt Disney ’s animation studio called Steamboat Willie , featuring Mickey Mouse in 1928 . In 1932 , the first short animated film created entirely with Technicolor ( using red / green / blue photographic filters and three strips of film in the camera ) was Disney 's Flowers and Trees , directed by Burt Gillett . The first full - color animated feature film was \" Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \" , also by Walt Disney . Through the 1930s and 1950s , the golden age of American animation saw new animated characters emerge , including Goofy , Donald Duck , Daisy Duck , Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Porky Pig , Betty Boop , Popeye , Sylvester the Cat , Woody Woodpecker , Tweety , Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner , Elmer Fudd , Foghorn Leghorn , Yosemite Sam , Tasmanian Devil , Hunky and Spunky , Droopy , Little Audrey , Tom and Jerry , Barney Bear , Mr. Magoo , Mighty Mouse , Gandy Goose , Heckle and Jeckle , George and Junior , the Fox and the Crow and the animated adoption of Superman , Baby Huey , Casper the Friendly Ghost , Little Lulu , among others . In 1958 , Hanna - Barbera released The Huckleberry Hound Show , the first half hour television program to feature only in animation . Terrytoons released Tom Terrific that same year . Television significantly decreased public attention to the animated shorts being shown in theaters . Computer animation has become popular since Toy Story ( 1995 ) , the first feature - length animated film completely made using this technique . In 2008 , the animation market was worth US$ 68.4 billion .", "entities": [{"start": 4, "end": 23, "label": ["73842"], "title": ["Gertie_the_Dinosaur"], "text": "Gertie the Dinosaur"}, {"start": 176, "end": 184, "label": ["323858"], "title": ["History_of_animation"], "text": "cartoons"}, {"start": 311, "end": 329, "label": ["8026237"], "title": ["John_Randolph_Bray"], "text": "John Randolph Bray"}, {"start": 358, "end": 367, "label": ["13135345"], "title": ["Earl_Hurd"], "text": "Earl Hurd"}, {"start": 383, "end": 396, "label": ["498464"], "title": ["Traditional_animation"], "text": "cel animation"}, {"start": 472, "end": 482, "label": ["8406481"], "title": ["El_Apóstol"], "text": "El Apóstol"}, {"start": 760, "end": 769, "label": ["2044294"], "title": ["Lost_film"], "text": "lost film"}, {"start": 808, "end": 822, "label": ["18080160"], "title": ["Feline_Follies"], "text": "Feline Follies"}, {"start": 843, "end": 856, "label": ["197889"], "title": ["Felix_the_Cat"], "text": "Felix the Cat"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1038, "label": ["4321732"], "title": ["The_Adventures_of_Prince_Achmed"], "text": "The Adventures of Prince Achmed"}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1079, "label": ["341981"], "title": ["Lotte_Reiniger"], "text": "Lotte Reiniger"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1111, "label": ["107853"], "title": ["Carl_Koch_(director)"], "text": "Carl Koch"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1133, "label": ["337476"], "title": ["Berthold_Bartosch"], "text": "Berthold Bartosch"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1242, "label": ["32917"], "title": ["Walt_Disney"], "text": "Walt Disney"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1286, "label": ["18943962"], "title": ["Steamboat_Willie"], "text": "Steamboat Willie"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1311, "label": ["20859"], "title": ["Mickey_Mouse"], "text": "Mickey Mouse"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1395, "label": ["30691222"], "title": ["Technicolor"], "text": "Technicolor"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1516, "label": ["238397"], "title": ["Flowers_and_Trees"], "text": "Flowers and Trees"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1543, "label": ["1361019"], "title": ["Burt_Gillett"], "text": "Burt Gillett"}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1628, "label": ["76361"], "title": ["Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)"], "text": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1721, "label": ["141957"], "title": ["Golden_age_of_American_animation"], "text": "golden age of American animation"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1774, "label": ["72798"], "title": ["Goofy"], "text": "Goofy"}, {"start": 1777, "end": 1788, "label": ["19179331"], "title": ["Donald_Duck"], "text": "Donald Duck"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1801, "label": ["9020"], "title": ["Daisy_Duck"], "text": "Daisy Duck"}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1814, "label": ["50286"], "title": ["Bugs_Bunny"], "text": "Bugs Bunny"}, {"start": 1817, "end": 1827, "label": ["51847"], "title": ["Daffy_Duck"], "text": "Daffy Duck"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1839, "label": ["51848"], "title": ["Porky_Pig"], "text": "Porky Pig"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1852, "label": ["203202"], "title": ["Betty_Boop"], "text": "Betty Boop"}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1861, "label": ["23387052"], "title": ["Popeye"], "text": "Popeye"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1881, "label": ["140625"], "title": ["Sylvester_the_Cat"], "text": "Sylvester the Cat"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1900, "label": ["200953"], "title": ["Woody_Woodpecker"], "text": "Woody Woodpecker"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1909, "label": ["88813"], "title": ["Tweety"], "text": "Tweety"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1942, "label": ["99799"], "title": ["Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner"], "text": "Wile E.

{"id": "3-0", "text": "Apollo appears often in the myths , plays and hymns . As Zeus ' favorite son , Apollo had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans . A divinity beyond human comprehension , he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god . Apollo was the son of Zeus and Leto , his previous wife , or one of his mistresses . After his birth , Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and Aletheia , the personification of truth . When Zeus ' wife Hera discovered that Leto was impregnated by Zeus , she banned Leto from giving birth on terra firma . In her wanderings , Leto sought shelter on many lands , only to be rejected by them . Finally , she saw Delos , a floating island , which was neither a real island nor a mainland . It is said that Apollo , still in Leto 's womb , had informed his mother about Delos to put an end to her suffering . Leto , when welcomed by Delos , gave birth there , clinging to a palm tree . It is also stated that Hera kidnapped Eileithyia , the goddess of childbirth , to prevent Leto from going into labor . The other gods tricked Hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards or 8.2 meters long . When Apollo was born clutching a golden sword , the swans circled Delos seven times and the nymphs sang in delight . Soon after he was born , he was washed clean by the goddesses and was covered in white garment , with golden bands fastened around him . Since Leto was unable to feed the new born , Themis , the goddess of divine law , fed him the nectar , or ambrosia . Upon tasting the divine food , Apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery , and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind . Apollo 's birth fixed the floating Delos to the earth . Leto was accepted by the people of Delos and she promised them that her son would be always favorable towards the city . According to some , Apollo secured Delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time . This island later became sacred to Apollo . Apollo was born on the seventh day ( , hebdomagenes ) of the month — according to Delian tradition — or of the month — according to Delphian tradition . The seventh and twentieth , the days of the new and full moon , were ever afterwards held sacred to him . Mythographers agree that Artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo , or that Artemis was born on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo . Hyperborea , the mystical land of eternal spring , venerated Apollo above all the gods . The Hyperboreans always sung and danced in his honor , and hosted Pythian games .

{"id": "3-1", "text": "Apollo spends the winter months among the Hyperboreans . His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death . No prophecies were issued during this time . He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring . The Theophania festival was held in Delphi to celebrate his return . It is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea , accompanied by a pack of wolves . Henceforth , Hyperborea became Apollo 's winter home and wolves became sacred to Apollo . His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet Lyceus , meaning wolf - like . But Apollo was also the wolf - slayer in his role of the pastoral god who protected flocks from predators . The hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god . Shamanistic elements in Apollo 's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin , and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman . Shamans like Abaris and Aristeas were also the followers of Apollo , who hailed from Hyperborea . In myths , Apollo wept tears of ambers on the banks of Eridanos when his son Asclepius died and buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the Cyclopes . He later gave this arrow to Abaris . As a child , Apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted . Since he learnt the art of building when young , he later became Archegetes , the founder of towns and god who guided men to build new cities . From his father Zeus , Apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans . In his young years when Apollo spent his time herding cows , he was reared by Thriae , the bee nymphs , who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills . Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre , and along with Artemis , the art of archery . He then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery . Phoebe , his grandmother , gave the oracular shrine of Delphi to Apollo as a birthday gift . Themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi thereon . Python , a chthonic serpent - dragon , was a child of Gaea and the guardian of the Delphic Oracle , whose death was foretold by Apollo when he was still in Leto 's womb . Python was the nurse of the giant Typhon . In most of the traditions , Apollo was still a child when he killed Python . Python was sent by Hera to hunt the pregnant Leto to death , and had assaulted Leto . To avenge the trouble given to his mother , the young Apollo , with his bow and arrows that he had received from Hephaestus , went in search of Python and killed it in the sacred cave at Delphi with his arrows .

Zeus sent Apollo to go to Delphi and establish his law and order there . But Apollo , disobeying his father , went to the land of Hyperborea and stayed there for a year . When he returned , he ascended back to Olympus . Zeus , pleased with his son 's integrity , gave Apollo the seat next to him on his right side . He also gifted to Apollo a golden tripod , a golden bow and arrows , a golden chariot and the land of Delphi . Soon after his return , Apollo needed to recruit people to Delphi . So , when he spotted a ship sailing from Crete , he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin . The crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to Delphi . There Apollo revealed himself as a god . Initiating them to his service , he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts . The Pythia was Apollo 's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies . Pythia is arguably the constant favorite of Apollo among the mortals . Hera once again sent another giant , Tityos to rape Leto . This time Apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword . According to other version , Artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows . After the battle Zeus finally relented his aid and hurled Tityos down to Tartarus . There , he was pegged to the rock floor , covering an area of , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver . King Admetus was the king of Pherae who was known for his hospitality . When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python , he served as a herdsman under Admetus who was still a young king . Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay of 9 years . After his servitude was over , Apollo went back to Olympus as a god . Because Admetus treated Apollo well , in return , the god conferred great benefits on him . Apollo 's mere presence is said to have made the cows give birth to twins . Out of love and gratitude , Apollo helped Admetus win Alcestis , the daughter of King Pelias . He was present during their wedding . When Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by neglecting to make her offerings , Apollo came to Admetus ' rescue and calmed his sister . Much later , Apollo convinced or tricked the Fates into letting Admetus live past his time .

Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of hard labor once again under Admetus . The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like Ovid and Servius . The fate of Niobe was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto 's womb . Niobe was the queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion . She displayed hubris when she boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children ( Niobids ) , seven male and seven female , while Leto had only two . She further mocked Apollo 's effeminate appearance and Artemis ' manly appearance . Leto , insulted by this , told her children to punish Niobe . Accordingly , Apollo killed Niobe 's sons , and Artemis her daughters . Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them , though according to some versions of the myth , among the Niobids , Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto . Amphion , at the sight of his dead sons , either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge . A devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos in Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept . Her tears formed the river Achelous . Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death , when the gods themselves entombed them . When Chloris married and had children , Apollo granted her son Nestor the years he had taken away from the Niobids . Hence , Nestor was able to live for 3 generations . Once Apollo , along with Athena and Poseidon , participated in Hera 's scheme to hold Zeus captive and demand a better rule from him . Though they were successful in trapping Zeus with nets , Zeus managed to get himself freed with the help of Thetis . Feeling betrayed and angry , he sent Apollo and Poseidon to serve as slaves under the Trojan king Laomedon . According to other version , both gods went there to test Laomedon . Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of mount Ida , while Poseidon built the walls of Troy . Later , Apollo was also joined hands in building the walls . In Pindar 's account , the gods took a mortal named Aeacus as their assistant . When the work was completed , three snakes rushed against the wall , and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead , the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus .

To deliver the city from it , Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter Hesione ( who would later be saved by Heracles ) . During his exile , Apollo had a lover named Ourea , a nymph daughter of Poseidon , and sired a son whom he named Ileus after the city . Apollo sided with the Trojans during the Trojan war , a war waged by the Greeks against the Trojans . During the war , Agamemnon , a Greek hero captured Chryseis , the daughter of Apollo 's priest Chryses . Angered , Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment . He demanded to return the girl , and the Achaeans ( Greeks ) complied , indirectly causing the , which is the theme of the Iliad . Receiving the aegis from Zeus , Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father 's wish , causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry , pushing them back and destroying many of them . He is described as \" the rouser of armies \" , because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart . When Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war , Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel . However , Apollo declined to fight him , saying that he would n't fight his uncle for the sake of mortals . When Diomedes , the Greek hero , injured Aeneas , a Trojan ally , Aphrodite tried to rescue him but Diomedes injured her as well . Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him . He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain himself from attacking a god . Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos , a sacred spot in Troy , where he was healed . After the death of Sarpedon , a son of Zeus , Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father 's wish and cleaned it . He then gave it to Sleep ( Hypnos ) and Death ( Thanatos ) . Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day , so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while . The Trojan hero Hector was favored by Apollo , who , according to some , was the god 's own son by Hecuba . When he got injured , Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up the arms . During a duel with Achilles , when Hector was about to lose , Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him .

Apollo held anger towards Achilles throughout the war . The reason for this was the murder of his son Tenes before the war began , and brutal assassination of his another son Troilus in his own temple , both by Achilles . Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles , he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates . He foiled Achilles ' attempt to mutilate Hector 's dead body . Finally , Apollo caused Achilles ' death by guiding an arrow shot by Paris into Achilles ' heel . In some versions , Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris . Apollo helped many Trojan warriors , including Agenor , Polydamas , Glaucus in the battlefield . Though he greatly favored the Trojans , Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war . After Heracles ( then named Alcides ) was struck with madness and killed his family , he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo . Apollo , through the Pythia , commanded him to serve king Eurystheus for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him . Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin . Apollo also renamed him as Heracles . To complete his third task , Heracles had to capture the Ceryneian Hind , a hind sacred to Artemis , and bring it alive . He chased the hind for one year . When the animal eventually got tired and tried crossing the river Ladon , he captured it . While he was taking it back , he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis , who was angered at Heracles for this act . However , Heracles soothed the goddess , explained the situation and pleaded her . In the end , Artemis gave her consent . After he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus , Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus , a prince of Oechalia , and murdered him . Soon after , he contracted a terrible disease . He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again , in hopes to get rid of the disease . The Pythia , however , denied to give any prophesy . In anger , Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started going away , intending to start his own Oracle . However , Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles . A duel ensued between Apollo and Heracles where Athena supported the latter . Soon , Zeus intervened between the fighting brothers by throwing his thunderbolt between them .

But because he was a just king and a good devotee , Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas . Zeus considered Apollo 's words and agreed to let him live . But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds . When Periphas ' wife requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband , Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish . A long time ago , there were three kinds of human beings : male , descended from the sun ; female , descended from the earth ; and androgynous , descended from the moon . Each human being was completely round , with four arms and fours legs , two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears , and all else to match . They were powerful and unruly . Otis and Ephialtes even dared to scale Mount Olympus . To check their insolence , Zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them . He cut them all in two and asked Apollo to make necessary repairs , giving humans the individual shape they still have now . Apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds , he pulled together their skin at the abdomen , and sewed the skin together at the middle of it . This is what we call navel today .

Asclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts by his father . However , he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education . Anius , Apollo 's son by Rhoeo , was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth . Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts . Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos . Iamus was the son of Apollo and Evadne . When he reached the age of education , Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts , including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds . Idmon was educated by Apollo to be a seer . Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the Argonauts , he embraced his destiny and died a brave death . To commemorate his son 's bravery , Apollo commanded Boetians to build a town around the tomb of the hero , and to honor him . Apollo adopted Carnus , the abandoned son of Zeus and Europa . He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer . Apollo saved a shepherd boy ( name unknown ) from death in a large deep cave , by the means of vultures . To thank him , the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius . Apollo 's music is soulful and enchanting . His music would deliver people from their pain , and hence , like Dionysus , he is also called the liberator . Apollo often appears as the companion of the Muses and as Musagetes , he leads them into dance while he sang . He is found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre . Apollo and the Muses are often seen on Parnassus , which is one of their favorite spots . Apollo was always invited to play music on weddings of the gods , like the marriage of Eros and Psyche , Peleus and Thetis . When Orpheus was still a child , Apollo gifted a lyre and taught him how to play it . Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others . He was the victor in all those contests , but usually punished his opponents severely for their hubris . The invention of lyre is attributed either to Hermes or to Apollo himself .

Zeus , having seen the events , sided with Apollo , and ordered Hermes to return the cattle . Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented . Apollo , a god of music , fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre . Hence , Apollo then became a master of the lyre . According to other versions , Apollo had invented the lyre himself , whose strings he tore in repent to the excess punishment he had given to Marsyas . Hermes ' lyre , therefore , is rather a reinvention . Once Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge Apollo , the god of music . The mountain - god Tmolus was chosen to umpire . Pan blew on his pipes , and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower , Midas , who happened to be present .

This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo , and he challenged the god to a musical contest . The contest was judged by the Muses , or the nymphs of Nysa .

According to one account , after they each had performed , both were deemed equal by the Nysiads . But in the next round , Apollo played and sang with his melodious voice at the same time . Marsyas argued against this , saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating . But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute , which needed air blown from the throat , it was almost the same as singing , and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all . The nymphs decided that Apollo 's argument was just . Apollo again played his lyre and sang at the same time , mesmerising the audience . Marsyas could not do this . Apollo was declared the winner and angered with Marsyas ' haughtiness and his accusation , he decided to flay the satyr . According to another account , Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat . Out of shame , he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack . Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument ( the lyre ) upside down . Marsyas could not do this with his instrument ( the flute ) , and so the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner , who hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him . Apollo flayed the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god . He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed Marsyas ' flayed skin to a nearby pine - tree . Marsyas ' blood turned into the river Marsyas . But , Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done , he broke the strings of his lyre and threw it away . The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo 's sons Linus and Orpheus . The Muses fixed the middle string , Linus the string struck with the forefinger , and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it .

He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the winter months , and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure . During his absence , Delphi was under the care of Dionysus , and no prophecies were given during winters . Molpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of Rhoeo , a former lover of Apollo . One day , they were put in charge of watching their father 's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty . While they were asleep , the wine jar was broken by the swines their family kept . When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened , they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father 's wrath . Apollo , who was passing by , caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus , Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus . He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors . Molpadia 's name was changed to Hemithea upon her deification . Prometheus was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire . He was bound to a rock , where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus ' liver , which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day . Seeing his plight , Apollo pleaded Zeus to release the kind Titan , while Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes . Zeus , moved by Apollo 's words and the tears of the goddesses , finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus . Leukatas was believed to be a white colored rock jutting out from the island of Leukas into the sea . It was present in the sanctuary of Apollo Leukates . A leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love . Once , Aphrodite fell deeply in love with Adonis , a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar . Heartbroken , Aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of Leukas . When she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos , she confided in him her love and sorrow . Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock . She did so and was freed from her love . When she sought for the reason behind this , Apollo told her that Zeus , before taking another lover , would sit on this rock to free himself from his love to Hera . Another tale relates that a man named Nireus , who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena , came to the rock and jumped in order relieve himself . After jumping , he fell into the net of a fisherman in which , when he was pulled out , he found a box filled with gold . He fought with the fisherman and took the gold , but Apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others .", "entities": [{"start": 10, "end": 16, "label": ["14410"], "title": ["Hermes"], "text": "Hermes"}, {"start": 148, "end": 160, "label": ["232942"], "title": ["Hyperborea"], "text": "Hyperboreans"}, {"start": 301, "end": 309, "label": ["63325"], "title": ["Dionysus"], "text": "Dionysus"}, {"start": 401, "end": 406, "label": ["78740"], "title": ["Rhoeo"], "text": "Rhoeo"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1064, "label": ["23250"], "title": ["Prometheus"], "text": "Prometheus"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1609, "label": ["239164"], "title": ["Lefkada"], "text": "Leukas"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1806, "label": ["77280"], "title": ["Adonis"], "text": "Adonis"}]}

This was the same rock from which , according to a legend , Sappho took her suicidal leap . Love affairs ascribed to Apollo are a late development in Greek mythology . Their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the Renaissance , the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination . Daphne was a nymph whose parentage varies . She scorned Apollo 's advances and ran away from him . When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her , she changed herself into a laurel tree . According to other versions , she cried for help during the chase , and Gaea helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place . According to Roman poet Ovid , the chase was brought about by Cupid , who hit Apollo with golden arrow of love and Daphne with leaden arrow of hatred . The myth explains the origin of the laurel and connection of Apollo with the laurel and its leaves , which his priestess employed at Delphi . The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the Pythian games . Apollo is said to have been the lover of all nine Muses , and not being able to choose one of them , decided to remain unwed .

Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves . Hecuba was the wife of King Priam of Troy , and Apollo had a son with her named Troilus .

After the sack of Troy , Hecuba was taken to Lycia by Apollo . Coronis , was daughter of Phlegyas , King of the Lapiths . While pregnant with Asclepius , Coronis fell in love with Ischys , son of Elatus and slept with him . When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers , he sent his sister , Artemis , to kill Coronis . Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Koronis ' belly and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise . In Euripides ' play Ion , Apollo fathered Ion by Creusa , wife of Xuthus . He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father . Later , when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild , Apollo asked Hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at Delphi , where he was raised by a priestess . Hyacinth or Hyacinthus was one of Apollo 's male lovers . He was a Spartan prince , beautiful and athletic . The pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head , killing him instantly . Apollo is said to be filled with grief : out of Hyacinthus ' blood , Apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death , and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection , meaning alas .

Artemis Daphnaia had her temple among the Lacedemonians , at a place called Hypsoi . Apollo Daphnephoros had a temple in Eretria , a \" place where the citizens are to take the oaths \" . In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or Helios , Artemis was naturally regarded as Selene or the moon . Hecate , the goddess of witchcraft and magic , is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo . They both are cousins , since their mothers - Leto and Asteria - are sisters . One of Apollo 's epithets , Hecatos , is the masculine form of Hecate , and both the names mean \" working from afar \" . While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven , Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness . If Hecate is the \" gate - keeper \" , Apollo Agyieus is the \" door - keeper \" . Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets . The oldest evidence found for Hecate 's worship is at Apollo 's temple in Miletos . There , Hecate was taken to be Apollo 's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis . Hecate 's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements , at the same time , Apollo 's solar nature . As a deity of knowledge and great power , Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of Athena . Being Zeus ' favorite children , they were given more powers and duties . Apollo and Athena often took up the role as protectors of cities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . Athena was the principle goddess of Athens , Apollo was the principle god of Sparta .

Orestes and Pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently Orestes is pursued by the Erinyes or Furies ( female personifications of vengeance ) . Apollo and the Furies argue about whether the matricide was justified ; Apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and Orestes was avenging his father , whereas the Erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage . They invade his temple , and he drives them away . He says that the matter should be brought before Athena . Apollo promises to protect Orestes , as Orestes has become Apollo 's supplicant . Apollo advocates Orestes at the trial , and ultimately Athena rules in favor of Apollo . The Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks . As a quintessentially Greek god , Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent , although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus . There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of Rome during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus .

In the time of Augustus , who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son , his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome . After the battle of Actium , which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo , Augustus enlarged Apollo 's temple , dedicated a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted quinquennial games in his honour .

At the Upward Sun River site in the Tanana River Valley in Alaska , remains of a six - week - old infant were found . The baby 's DNA showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the New World at the end of the Pleistocene . Ben Potter , the University of Alaska Fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the Upward River Sun site in 2013 , named this new group Ancient Beringians . The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska , along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon . Also in Southeast were the Haida , now well known for their unique arts . The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887 , when President Grover Cleveland , and later the U.S. Congress , granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla . All three of these peoples , as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast , experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century , with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s , resulting in high fatalities and social disruption .

The Gwich'in people of the northern Interior region are Athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much - contested Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .

According to this hypothesis , in 1648 several koches of Semyon Dezhnyov 's expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement . This hypothesis is based on the testimony of Chukchi geographer Nikolai Daurkin , who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the Kheuveren River , populated by \" bearded men \" who \" pray to the icons \" .

Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741 , when Vitus Bering led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St. Peter . After his crew returned to Russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world , small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands . The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784 . Between 1774 and 1800 , Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest . In 1789 a Spanish settlement and fort were built in Nootka Sound . These expeditions gave names to places such as Valdez , Bucareli Sound , and Cordova . Later , the Russian - American Company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early - to - mid-19th century . Sitka , renamed New Archangel from 1804 to 1867 , on Baranof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in what is now Southeast Alaska , became the capital of Russian America . It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States . The Russians never fully colonized Alaska , and the colony was never very profitable . Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska .

European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska , where they entered the fishing and logging industries . During World War II , the Aleutian Islands Campaign focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands – Attu , Agattu and Kiska – that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943 . During the occupation , one Aleut civilian was killed by Japanese troops and nearly fifty were interned in Japan , where about half of them died . Unalaska / Dutch Harbor became a significant base for the United States Army Air Forces and Navy submariners . The United States Lend - Lease program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome ; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft , ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union . The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities . Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of James Wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate . Decades later , the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946 . The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska 's Constitutional Convention would soon follow . Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes , mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska . Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7 , 1958 . Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3 , 1959 . In 1960 , the Census Bureau reported Alaska 's population as 77.2 % White , 3 % Black , and 18.8 % American Indian and Alaska Native . On March 27 , 1964 , the massive Good Friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities , mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides . It was the second - most - powerful earthquake in the recorded history of the world , with a moment magnitude of 9.2 . It was over one thousand times more powerful than the 1989 San Francisco earthquake .", "entities": [{"start": 306, "end": 321, "label": ["34230"], "title": ["Yukon"], "text": "Yukon Territory"}, {"start": 484, "end": 489, "label": ["87486"], "title": ["Sitka,_Alaska"], "text": "Sitka"}, {"start": 522, "end": 528, "label": ["87469"], "title": ["Juneau,_Alaska"], "text": "Juneau"}, {"start": 551, "end": 577, "label": ["8205646"], "title": ["Alaska_Governor's_Mansion"], "text": "Alaska Governor 's Mansion"}, {"start": 761, "end": 786, "label": ["1095689"], "title": ["Aleutian_Islands_campaign"], "text": "Aleutian Islands Campaign"}, {"start": 833, "end": 837, "label": ["226214"], "title": ["Attu_Island"], "text": "Attu"}, {"start": 840, "end": 846, "label": ["2631046"], "title": ["Agattu"], "text": "Agattu"}, {"start": 851, "end": 856, "label": ["462492"], "title": ["Kiska"], "text": "Kiska"}, {"start": 973, "end": 978, "label": ["3034"], "title": ["Aleut"], "text": "Aleut"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1100, "label": ["105213"], "title": ["Unalaska,_Alaska"], "text": "Unalaska"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1115, "label": ["442120"], "title": ["Dutch_Harbor"], "text": "Dutch Harbor"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1179, "label": ["23508196"], "title": ["United_States_Army_Air_Forces"], "text": "United States Army Air Forces"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1188, "label": ["20518076"], "title": ["United_States_Navy"], "text": "Navy"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1200, "label": ["28825"], "title": ["Submarine"], "text": "submariners"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1233, "label": ["55832"], "title": ["Lend-Lease"], "text": "Lend - Lease"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1603, "label": ["1610747"], "title": ["James_Wickersham"], "text": "James Wickersham"}, {"start": 2289, "end": 2311, "label": ["240447"], "title": ["1964_Alaska_earthquake"], "text": "Good Friday earthquake"}, {"start": 2429, "end": 2437, "label": ["31161"], "title": ["Tsunami"], "text": "tsunamis"}, {"start": 2548, "end": 2564, "label": ["631494"], "title": ["Moment_magnitude_scale"], "text": "moment magnitude"}, {"start": 2628, "end": 2657, "label": ["261671"], "title": ["1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake"], "text": "1989 San Francisco earthquake"}]}

The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide . The Alaska Legislature consists of a 40 - member House of Representatives and a 20 - member Senate . Senators serve four - year terms and House members two . The governor of Alaska serves four - year terms .

Alaska 's court system has four levels : the Alaska Supreme Court , the Alaska Court of Appeals , the superior courts and the district courts . The superior and district courts are trial courts . Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction , while district courts only hear certain types of cases , including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $ 100,000 . The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are appellate courts . The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower - court decisions , including those regarding criminal prosecutions , juvenile delinquency , and habeas corpus . The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals . Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a Democratic state , since the early 1970s it has been characterized as Republican - leaning . Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development , fishing , tourism , and individual rights . Alaska Natives , while organized in and around their communities , have been active within the Native corporations . These have been given ownership over large tracts of land , which require stewardship . Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one 's home was completely legal under state law , though the federal law remains in force . The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States , with the Alaskan Independence Party . Six Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska . In addition , Republican governor Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected .

The new law means people over age 21 can consume small amounts of pot – if they can find it . There is a rather lengthy and involved application process , per Alaska Measure 2 ( 2014 ) . The first legal marijuana store opened in Valdez in October 2016 . To finance state government operations , Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies . This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States . It is one of five states with no state sales tax , one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax , and one of the two states that has neither ( New Hampshire is the other one ) The Department of Revenue Tax Division reports regularly on the state 's revenue sources . The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations , including new state laws that directly affect the tax division . While Alaska has no state sales tax , 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax , from 1.0–7.5 % , typically 3–5 % . Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes , hotel , motel , and bed - and - breakfast ' bed ' taxes , severance taxes , liquor and tobacco taxes , gaming ( pull tabs ) taxes , tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes . A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees ( such as petroleum , aviation motor fuel , telephone cooperative ) is shared with municipalities in Alaska . Fairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the Fairbanks North Star Borough ( FNSB ) . A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times , but has yet to be approved , leading lawmakers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco . In 2014 the Tax Foundation ranked Alaska as having the fourth most \" business friendly \" tax policy , behind only Wyoming , South Dakota , and Nevada . Alaska regularly supports Republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood . Republicans have won the state 's electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in ( 1964 ) . No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times . Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson during his landslide election in 1964 , while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close . Since 1972 , however , Republicans have carried the state by large margins . In 2008 , Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska , 59.49 % to 37.83 % .

{"id": "7-0", "text": "= = = Global use=== The vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction : primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications . According to the requirements of the end use , asphalt is produced to specification . This is achieved either by refining or blending . It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year . Approximately 85 % of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads . It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways , car parks and footways . Typically , the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand , gravel and crushed rock with asphalt , which acts as the binding agent . Other materials , such as recycled polymers ( e.g. , rubber tyres ) , may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended . A further 10 % of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications , where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable . The remaining 5 % of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials , such as pipe coatings , carpet tile backing and paint . Asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures , systems , and components , such as the following : * Highways * Airport runways * Footways and pedestrian ways * Car parks * Racetracks * Tennis courts * Roofing * Damp proofing * Dams * Reservoir and pool linings * Soundproofing * Pipe coatings * Cable coatings * Paints * Building water proofing * Tile underlying waterproofing * Newspaper ink production * and many other applications The largest use of asphalt is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces ; this accounts for approximately 85 % of the asphalt consumed in the United States . There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the US , and a similar number in Europe . Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5 % asphalt cement and 95 % aggregates ( stone , sand , and gravel ) . Due to its highly viscous nature , asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility . The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates , but warm - mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required . The weight of an asphalt pavement depends upon the aggregate type , the asphalt , and the air void content . An average example in the United States is about 112 pounds per square yard , per inch of pavement thickness .", "entities": [{"start": 463, "end": 469, "label": ["2076473"], "title": ["Binder_(material)"], "text": "binder"}, {"start": 669, "end": 679, "label": ["7096085"], "title": ["Construction_aggregate"], "text": "aggregates"}, {"start": 688, "end": 692, "label": ["18994037"], "title": ["Sand"], "text": "sand"}, {"start": 695, "end": 701, "label": ["167120"], "title": ["Gravel"], "text": "gravel"}, {"start": 821, "end": 827, "label": ["38393"], "title": ["Natural_rubber"], "text": "rubber"}, {"start": 828, "end": 833, "label": ["65037"], "title": ["Tire"], "text": "tyres"}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1789, "label": ["387797"], "title": ["Asphalt_concrete"], "text": "asphalt concrete"}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2392, "label": ["387797"], "title": ["Asphalt_concrete"], "text": "warm - mix asphalt technologies"}]}
{"id": "7-1", "text": "When maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements , such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface , the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures . The asphalt in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes . With some 95 % of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt , a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year . According to industry surveys conducted annually by the Federal Highway Administration and the National Asphalt Pavement Association , more than 99 % of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments . Asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world . Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly , it is widely used for runways . Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt ( asphalt concrete ) in that it has a higher asphalt ( binder ) content , usually around 7–10 % of the whole aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete , which has only around 5 % asphalt . This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground . Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about thick . A number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures . These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form \" cutbacks \" with reduced melting point or mixing with water to turn the asphalt into an emulsion . Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70 % asphalt and typically less than 1.5 % chemical additives . There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates , cationic and anionic . Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications . Chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock , gravel or crushed slag . Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road . Cold - mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot - mixed asphalt , several inches in depth , and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot - mix asphalt to create low - cost pavements . Synthetic crude oil , also known as syncrude , is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada . Bituminous sands are mined using enormous ( 100 ton capacity ) power shovels and loaded into even larger ( 400 ton capacity ) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility .", "entities": [{"start": 61, "end": 68, "label": ["42212963"], "title": ["Pavement_milling"], "text": "milling"}, {"start": 510, "end": 540, "label": ["1339400"], "title": ["Federal_Highway_Administration"], "text": "Federal Highway Administration"}, {"start": 924, "end": 931, "label": ["165094"], "title": ["Runway"], "text": "runways"}, {"start": 934, "end": 948, "label": ["387797"], "title": ["Asphalt_concrete"], "text": "Mastic asphalt"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1027, "label": ["387797"], "title": ["Asphalt_concrete"], "text": "asphalt concrete"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1070, "label": ["2076473"], "title": ["Binder_(material)"], "text": "binder"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1677, "label": ["10290"], "title": ["Emulsion"], "text": "emulsion"}, {"start": 1855, "end": 1863, "label": ["18963787"], "title": ["Ion"], "text": "cationic"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1875, "label": ["18963787"], "title": ["Ion"], "text": "anionic"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1949, "label": ["6005240"], "title": ["Chipseal"], "text": "Chipseal"}, {"start": 2662, "end": 2675, "label": ["7107907"], "title": ["Power_shovel"], "text": "power shovels"}, {"start": 2725, "end": 2736, "label": ["1110017"], "title": ["Dump_truck"], "text": "dump trucks"}]}
{"id": "7-2", "text": "The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s . After extraction from the sand , the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent . This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment . By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over per day of synthetic crude oil , of which 75 % was exported to oil refineries in the United States . In Alberta , five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products : The Suncor Energy upgrader near Fort McMurray , Alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel ; the Syncrude Canada , Canadian Natural Resources , and Nexen upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil ; and the Shell Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery . A sixth upgrader , under construction in 2015 near Redwater , Alberta , will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel , with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants . Canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra - heavy and Mexican heavy oil in chemical composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery . Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non - upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline , diesel fuel , and refined asphalt without any preprocessing . This is particularly common in areas such as the US Gulf coast , where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil , and in areas such as the US Midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined . Given the choice , such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower , and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline . By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non - upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over per day , of which about 65 % was exported to the United States . Because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines , non - upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural - gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil , called synbit .", "entities": [{"start": 101, "end": 115, "label": ["8426130"], "title": ["Karl_Clark_(chemist)"], "text": "Dr. Karl Clark"}, {"start": 123, "end": 144, "label": ["242057"], "title": ["University_of_Alberta"], "text": "University of Alberta"}, {"start": 223, "end": 239, "label": ["2055144"], "title": ["Upgrader"], "text": "bitumen upgrader"}, {"start": 265, "end": 280, "label": ["2444991"], "title": ["Light_crude_oil"], "text": "light crude oil"}, {"start": 374, "end": 387, "label": ["51111"], "title": ["Pipeline_transport"], "text": "oil pipelines"}, {"start": 726, "end": 739, "label": ["1724529"], "title": ["Suncor_Energy"], "text": "Suncor Energy"}, {"start": 754, "end": 777, "label": ["329151"], "title": ["Fort_McMurray"], "text": "Fort McMurray , Alberta"}, {"start": 830, "end": 845, "label": ["2221329"], "title": ["Syncrude"], "text": "Syncrude Canada"}, {"start": 848, "end": 874, "label": ["30872967"], "title": ["Canadian_Natural_Resources"], "text": "Canadian Natural Resources"}, {"start": 881, "end": 886, "label": ["2335829"], "title": ["CNOOC_Petroleum_North_America"], "text": "Nexen"}, {"start": 960, "end": 977, "label": ["15007619"], "title": ["Scotford_Upgrader"], "text": "Scotford Upgrader"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1157, "label": ["3521846"], "title": ["Redwater,_Alberta"], "text": "Redwater , Alberta"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1445, "label": ["2445000"], "title": ["Heavy_crude_oil"], "text": "heavy oil"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1557, "label": ["51111"], "title": ["Pipeline_transport"], "text": "oil pipelines"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1836, "label": ["11969"], "title": ["Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States"], "text": "Gulf coast"}, {"start": 1938, "end": 1945, "label": ["104697"], "title": ["Midwestern_United_States"], "text": "Midwest"}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2574, "label": ["613606"], "title": ["Natural-gas_condensate"], "text": "natural - gas condensate"}, {"start": 2592, "end": 2598, "label": ["6498360"], "title": ["Dilbit"], "text": "dilbit"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2642, "label": ["6498360"], "title": ["Dilbit"], "text": "synbit"}]}
{"id": "7-3", "text": "However , to meet international competition , much non - upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen , conventional crude oil , synthetic crude oil , and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as Western Canadian Select . This sour , heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as Mexican Mayan or Arabian Dubai Crude . Asphalt was used starting in the 1960s as a hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium - activity salts ( mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate ) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds . Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France , Belgium and Japan , but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues ( risks of fire , as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan ) and long - term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations . One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water . Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis . A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve . The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix . The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts , the asphalt acting as a semi - permeable membrane . This also causes the matrix to swell . The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar . If not properly managed , this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium - level waste . When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling , encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere . The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks . The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions , preventing the reduction of redox - sensitive radionuclides .", "entities": [{"start": 235, "end": 258, "label": ["38216008"], "title": ["Western_Canadian_Select"], "text": "Western Canadian Select"}, {"start": 408, "end": 421, "label": ["16854047"], "title": ["Petroleum_industry_in_Mexico"], "text": "Mexican Mayan"}, {"start": 433, "end": 444, "label": ["2601742"], "title": ["Dubai_Crude"], "text": "Dubai Crude"}, {"start": 491, "end": 502, "label": ["14136"], "title": ["Hydrophobe"], "text": "hydrophobic"}, {"start": 599, "end": 613, "label": ["200310"], "title": ["Sodium_nitrate"], "text": "sodium nitrate"}, {"start": 618, "end": 632, "label": ["794439"], "title": ["Sodium_sulfate"], "text": "sodium sulfate"}, {"start": 667, "end": 686, "label": ["4094572"], "title": ["Spent_nuclear_fuel"], "text": "spent nuclear fuels"}, {"start": 702, "end": 709, "label": ["44275839"], "title": ["Sludge"], "text": "sludges"}, {"start": 785, "end": 795, "label": ["202522"], "title": ["Ionizing_radiation"], "text": "radiotoxic"}, {"start": 796, "end": 816, "label": ["31537"], "title": ["Transuranium_element"], "text": "transuranic elements"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1163, "label": ["3885807"], "title": ["Deep_geological_repository"], "text": "geological disposal"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1359, "label": ["13255"], "title": ["Hydrogen"], "text": "hydrogen"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1411, "label": ["2909744"], "title": ["Radiolysis"], "text": "radiolysis"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1489, "label": ["116790"], "title": ["Hygroscopy"], "text": "hygroscopic"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1675, "label": ["18600440"], "title": ["Osmosis"], "text": "osmotic"}, {"start": 1801, "end": 1826, "label": ["213887"], "title": ["Semipermeable_membrane"], "text": "semi - permeable membrane"}, {"start": 2282, "end": 2296, "label": ["2619023"], "title": ["Ionic_strength"], "text": "ionic strength"}, {"start": 2462, "end": 2467, "label": ["66313"], "title": ["Redox"], "text": "redox"}]}

The extra spurious cycle stealing , as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter , caused the computer alarms . When Armstrong again looked outside , he saw that the computer 's landing target was in a boulder - strewn area just north and east of a crater ( later determined to be West crater ) , so he took semi - automatic control . Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it , but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high . Throughout the descent , Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong , who was busy piloting Eagle . Now above the surface , Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site . Armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it . As he got closer , now above the surface , he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it . He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground . They were now from the surface , with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining . Lunar dust kicked up by the LM 's engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecraft 's motion . Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud , and Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft 's speed . A light informed Aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from Eagle footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said : \" Contact light ! \" Armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down , as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engine 's own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode , but he forgot . Three seconds later , Eagle landed and Armstrong shut the engine down . Aldrin immediately said \" Okay , engine stop . ACA — out of detent . \" Armstrong acknowledged : \" Out of detent . Auto . \" Aldrin continued : \" Mode control — both auto . Descent engine command override off . Engine arm — off . 413 is in . \" ACA was the Attitude Control Assembly — the LM 's control stick . Output went to the LGC to command the reaction control system ( RCS ) jets to fire . \" Out of Detent \" meant the stick had moved away from its centered position ; it was spring - centered like the turn indicator in a car .

Information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the LM had enough fuel for another 25 seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe , but post - mission analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to 50 seconds . Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions , and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning . This was later found to be the result of greater propellant ' slosh ' than expected , uncovering a fuel sensor . On subsequent missions , extra anti - slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this . Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin 's completion of the post landing checklist with \" Engine arm is off \" , before responding to the CAPCOM , Charles Duke , with the words , \" Houston , Tranquility Base here . The Eagle has landed . \" Armstrong 's unrehearsed change of call sign from \" Eagle \" to \" Tranquility Base \" emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful . Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control : \" Roger , Twan — Tranquility , we copy you on the ground . You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue . We 're breathing again . Thanks a lot . \" Two and a half hours after landing , before preparations began for the EVA , Aldrin radioed to Earth : He then took communion privately . At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair ( who had objected to the Apollo8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis ) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space . As such , Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon . Aldrin was an elder at the Webster Presbyterian Church , and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church , Dean Woodruff . Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20 . The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five - hour sleep period , but they chose to begin preparations for the EVA early , thinking they would be unable to sleep . Preparations for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the Moon began at 23:43 . These took longer than expected ; three and a half hours instead of two . During training on Earth , everything required had been neatly laid out in advance , but on the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well , such as checklists , food packets , and tools .

{"id": "8-4", "text": "Eagles hatch was opened at 02:39:33 . Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system ( PLSS ) . Some of the highest heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress . At 02:51 Armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface . The remote control unit on his chest kept him from seeing his feet . Climbing down the nine - rung ladder , Armstrong pulled a D - ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly ( MESA ) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera . Apollo 11 used slow - scan television ( TV ) incompatible with broadcast TV , so it was displayed on a special monitor , and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor , significantly reducing the quality of the picture . The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States , but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station near Canberra in Australia . Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia . Despite some technical and weather difficulties , ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth . Copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available , but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re - use at NASA . While still on the ladder , Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth ( of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres ) , an inscription , and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon . The inscription read : At the behest of the Nixon administration to add a reference to God , NASA included the vague date as a reason to include A.D. , which stands for Anno Domini , \" in the year of our Lord \" ( although it should have been placed before the year , not after ) . After describing the surface dust as \" very fine - grained \" and \" almost like a powder \" , at 02:56:15 , six and a half hours after landing , Armstrong stepped off Eagle footpad and declared : \" That 's one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . \" Armstrong intended to say \" That 's one small step for a man \" , but the word \" a \" is not audible in the transmission , and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast .

More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the \" a \" may have been spoken but obscured by static . About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon 's surface , Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick . He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh . This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM . Twelve minutes after the sample was collected , he removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep , then mounted it on a tripod . The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA . Still photography was accomplished with a Hasselblad camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on Armstrong 's Apollo space suit . Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface . He described the view with the simple phrase : \" Magnificent desolation . \" Armstrong said moving in the lunar gravity , one - sixth of Earth 's , was \" even perhaps easier than the simulations ... It 's absolutely no trouble to walk around . \" Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around , including two - footed kangaroo hops . The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward , but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance . Loping became the preferred method of movement . The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead . The fine soil was quite slippery . Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into Eagle shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit , but the helmet was warmer in sunlight , so he felt cooler in shadow . The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow , slowing work somewhat . As they worked , the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits . The astronauts planted the Lunar Flag Assembly containing a flag of the United States on the lunar surface , in clear view of the TV camera . Aldrin remembered , \" Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising . \" But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole a couple of inches ( 5 cm ) into the hard lunar surface .

They deployed the EASEP , which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment . Then Armstrong walked from the LM to snap photos at the rim of Little West Crater while Aldrin collected two core samples . He used the geologist 's hammer to pound in the tubes — the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11 — but was unable to penetrate more than deep . The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles . Many of the surface activities took longer than expected , so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes . Aldrin shoveled of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly . Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples : basalt and breccia . Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts : armalcolite , tranquillityite , and pyroxferroite . Armalcolite was named after Armstrong , Aldrin , and Collins . All have subsequently been found on Earth . Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong his metabolic rates were high , and that he should slow down . He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out . As metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk , Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15 - minute extension . In a 2010 interview , Armstrong explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk 's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts ' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon . Aldrin entered Eagle first . With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor ( LEC ) . This proved to be an inefficient tool , and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand . Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket , and Aldrin tossed the bag down .

Presidential speech writer William Safire had prepared an In Event of Moon Disaster announcement for Nixon to read in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon . The remarks were in a memo from Safire to Nixon 's White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman , in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster . According to the plan , Mission Control would \" close down communications \" with the LM , and a clergyman would \" commend their souls to the deepest of the deep \" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea . The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke 's First World War poem , \" The Soldier \" . While moving inside the cabin , Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon . There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine , stranding them on the Moon . A felt - tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch ; had this not worked , the LM circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine .

During his day flying solo around the Moon , Collins never felt lonely . Although it has been said \" not since Adam has any human known such solitude \" , Collins felt very much a part of the mission . In his autobiography he wrote : \" this venture has been structured for three men , and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two \" . In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while Columbia passed round the far side of the Moon , the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness , but rather \" awareness , anticipation , satisfaction , confidence , almost exultation \" . One of Collins ' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground . To give Collins an idea where to look , Mission Control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about four miles off target . Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site , he tried in vain to find the module . On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon , Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return . Just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit , Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant . If it became too cold , parts of Columbia might freeze . Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17 . Instead , Collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again , and carried on with normal housekeeping chores , while keeping an eye on the temperature . When Columbia came back around to the near side of the Moon again , he was able to report that the problem had been resolved . For the next couple of orbits , he described his time on the back side of the Moon as \" relaxing \" . After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA , Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous . While the flight plan called for Eagle to meet up with Columbia , Collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly Columbia down to meet Eagle .

Nixon welcomed the astronauts back to Earth .

The astronauts arrived at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at 10:00 UTC on July 28 . Columbia was taken to Ford Island for deactivation , and its pyrotechnics made safe . It was then taken to Hickham Air Force Base , from whence it was flown to Houston in a Douglas C-133 Cargomaster , reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July 30 . In accordance with the Extra - Terrestrial Exposure Law , a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its quarantine protocol , the astronauts continued in quarantine . After three weeks in confinement ( first in the Apollo spacecraft , then in their trailer on Hornet , and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory ) , the astronauts were given a clean bill of health .

Loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study . On August 13 , the three astronauts rode in ticker - tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago , with an estimated six million attendees . On the same evening in Los Angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight , attended by members of Congress , 44 governors , the Chief Justice of the United States , and ambassadors from 83 nations at the Century Plaza Hotel .

The essay 's approach has been copied many times . In his book A Modest Proposal ( 1984 ) , the evangelical author Frank Schaeffer emulated Swift 's work in a social conservative polemic against abortion and euthanasia , imagining a future dystopia that advocates recycling of aborted embryos , fetuses , and some disabled infants with compound intellectual , physical and physiological difficulties . ( Such Baby Doe Rules cases were then a major concern of the US pro - life movement of the early 1980s , which viewed selective treatment of those infants as disability discrimination . ) In his book A Modest Proposal for America ( 2013 ) , statistician Howard Friedman opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultra - conservatives . In the 1998 edition of The Handmaid 's Tale by Margaret Atwood there is a quote from A Modest Proposal before the introduction . A Modest Video Game Proposal is the title of an open letter sent by activist / former attorney Jack Thompson on 10 October 2005 .

The letter protests against the burning of Vietnamese people occurring overseas .

The 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan ; while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60 ° N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49 ° N. The province extends north to south and east to west at its maximum width . Its highest point is at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast . With the exception of the semi - arid steppe of the south - eastern section , the province has adequate water resources . There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming , fishing and a range of water sports . There are three large lakes , Lake Claire ( ) in Wood Buffalo National Park , Lesser Slave Lake ( ) , and Lake Athabasca ( ) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan . The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca . The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m < sup>3</sup>/s . The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River , a tributary of the Mackenzie River . Alberta 's capital city , Edmonton , is located at about the geographic centre of the province . It is the most northerly major city in Canada , and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada . The region , with its proximity to Canada 's largest oil fields , has most of western Canada 's oil refinery capacity .

Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming , with mixed farming more common in the north and centre , while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south . The Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta , where the Red Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland , and features deep canyons and striking landforms . Dinosaur Provincial Park , near Brooks , Alberta , showcases the badlands terrain , desert flora , and remnants from Alberta 's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape .

The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north , which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter . As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta , the temperature can change rapidly . Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from in northern Alberta to in southern Alberta , although temperatures at these extremes are rare . In the summer , continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from in the mountains to over in southeastern Alberta . Alberta is a sunny province . Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1,900 up to just under 2,600 hours per year . Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer . Alberta extends for over from north to south ; its climate , therefore , varies considerably . Average high temperatures in January range from in the southwest to in the far north . The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest , which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province , casting a rain shadow over much of Alberta . The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean .

In the summer , the average daytime temperatures range from around in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north , up to around in the dry prairie of the southeast . The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures . The south and east - central portions are prone to drought - like conditions sometimes persisting for several years , although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation , sometimes resulting in flooding . In southwestern Alberta , the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm , dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains , which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period . During one chinook recorded at Pincher Creek , temperatures soared from in just one hour . The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks , averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year . Calgary has a 56 % chance of a white Christmas , while Edmonton has an 86 % chance . Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate . The agricultural area of southern Alberta has a semi - arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants . The southeastern corner of Alberta , part of the Palliser Triangle , experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province , and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts . Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds . Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland , a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north . After Saskatchewan , Alberta experiences the most tornadoes in Canada with an average of 15 verified per year . Thunderstorms , some of them severe , are frequent in the summer , especially in central and southern Alberta .

Aspen poplar , balsam poplar ( or in some parts cottonwood ) , and paper birch are the primary large deciduous species . Conifers include jack pine , Rocky Mountain pine , lodgepole pine , both white and black spruce , and the deciduous conifer tamarack . The four climatic regions ( alpine , boreal forest , parkland , and prairie ) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals . The south and central prairie was the land of the bison , commonly known as buffalo , its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo . The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement , but since then buffalo have made a comeback , living on farms and in parks all over Alberta .

Rivers and lakes are populated with pike , walleye , whitefish , rainbow , speckled , brown trout , and sturgeon . Bull trout , native to the province , is Alberta 's provincial fish . Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province . Frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in Alberta . Alberta is the only province in Canada — as well as one of the few places in the world — that is free of Norwegian rats . Since the early 1950s , the Government of Alberta has operated a rat - control program , which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported , usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail . In 2006 , Alberta Agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats ; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners . It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description ; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos , universities and colleges , and recognized research institutions . In 2009 , several rats were found and captured , in small pockets in southern Alberta , putting Alberta 's rat - free status in jeopardy . A colony of rats were subsequently found in a landfill near Medicine Hat in 2012 , and again in 2014 . Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world . Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons , isolated material , microvertebrate remains , and even mass graves . At least 38 dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province . The Foremost Formation , Oldman Formation and Dinosaur Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur - bearing strata in Alberta .

On May 25 , 4,500 British reinforcements arrived with generals William Howe , John Burgoyne , and Henry Clinton . The British seized the Charlestown peninsula on June 17 after a costly frontal assault , leading Howe to replace Gage . Many senior officers were dismayed at the attack , which had gained them little , while Gage wrote to London stressing the need for a large army to suppress the revolt . On July 3 , George Washington took command of the Continental Army besieging Boston . Howe made no effort to attack , much to Washington 's surprise . A plan was rejected to assault the city , and the Americans instead fortified Dorchester Heights in early March 1776 with heavy artillery captured from a raid on Fort Ticonderoga . The British were permitted to withdraw unmolested on March 17 , and they sailed to Halifax , Nova Scotia . Washington then moved his army to New York . Starting in August 1775 , American Privateers began to raid villages in Nova Scotia , first at Saint John , then Charlottetown and Yarmouth . They continued in 1776 at Canso and then a land assault on Fort Cumberland . Meanwhile , British officials in Quebec began lobbying Indian tribes to support them , while the Americans urged them to maintain their neutrality . In April 1775 , Congress feared an Anglo - Indian attack from Canada and authorized an invasion of Quebec . Quebec had a largely Francophone population and had been under British rule for only 12 years , and the Americans expected that they would welcome being liberated from the British . The Americans attacked Quebec City on December 31 after an arduous march but were defeated . After a loose siege , the Americans withdrew on May 6 . 1776 . A failed counter - attack on June 8 ended American operations in Quebec . However , the British could not conduct an aggressive pursuit because of American ships on Lake Champlain . On October 11 , the British defeated the American squadron , forcing them to withdraw to Ticonderoga and ending the campaign . The invasion cost the Patriots their support in British public opinion , while aggressive anti - Loyalist policies diluted Canadian support . The Patriots continued to view Quebec as a strategic aim , though no further attempts to invade were ever made .

News of the campaign was well received in Britain . Festivities took place in London , public support reached a peak , and the King awarded the Order of the Bath to William Howe . The successes led to predictions that the British could win within a year . The American defeat revealed what one writer views as Washington 's strategic deficiencies , such as dividing a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one , his inexperienced staff misreading the situation , and his troops fleeing in disorder when fighting began . In the meantime , the British entered winter quarters and were in a good place to resume campaigning . On December 25 , 1776 , Washington stealthily crossed the Delaware River , and his army overwhelmed the Hessian ( soldier ) garrison at Trenton , New Jersey , the following morning , taking 900 prisoners . The decisive victory rescued the army 's flagging morale and gave a new hope to the cause for independence . Cornwallis marched to retake Trenton , but his efforts were repulsed on January 2 . Washington outmanoeuvred Cornwallis that night , and defeated his rearguard the following day . The victories proved instrumental in convincing the French and Spanish that the Americans were worthwhile allies , as well as recovering morale in the army . Washington entered winter quarters at Morristown , New Jersey , on January 6 , though a protracted guerrilla conflict continued . While encamped , Howe made no attempt to attack , much to Washington 's amazement . In December 1776 , John Burgoyne returned to London to set strategy with Lord George Germain . Burgoyne 's plan was to establish control of the Champlain - George - Hudson route from New York to Quebec , isolating New England . Efforts could then be concentrated on the southern colonies , where it was believed Loyalist support was in abundance .", "entities": [{"start": 0, "end": 13, "label": ["218888"], "title": ["Henry_Clinton_(British_Army_officer,_born_1730)"], "text": "Henry Clinton"}, {"start": 28, "end": 50, "label": ["73352"], "title": ["Newport,_Rhode_Island"], "text": "Newport , Rhode Island"}, {"start": 359, "end": 377, "label": ["23362908"], "title": ["Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis"], "text": "Charles Cornwallis"}, {"start": 715, "end": 727, "label": ["50585"], "title": ["Philadelphia"], "text": "Philadelphia"}, {"start": 961, "end": 978, "label": ["311455"], "title": ["Order_of_the_Bath"], "text": "Order of the Bath"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1402, "label": ["2074294"], "title": ["Cantonment"], "text": "winter quarters"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1505, "label": ["1847605"], "title": ["George_Washington's_crossing_of_the_Delaware_River"], "text": "crossed"}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1524, "label": ["52616"], "title": ["Delaware_River"], "text": "Delaware River"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1551, "label": ["230033"], "title": ["Battle_of_Trenton"], "text": "overwhelmed"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1575, "label": ["336315"], "title": ["Hessian_(soldier)"], "text": "Hessian ( soldier )"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1608, "label": ["57843"], "title": ["Trenton,_New_Jersey"], "text": "Trenton , New Jersey"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1835, "label": ["2482150"], "title": ["Battle_of_the_Assunpink_Creek"], "text": "were repulsed"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1926, "label": ["218910"], "title": ["Battle_of_Princeton"], "text": "defeated his rearguard"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2005, "label": ["2687967"], "title": ["Kingdom_of_France"], "text": "French"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2017, "label": ["303062"], "title": ["Spanish_Empire"], "text": "Spanish"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2166, "label": ["125569"], "title": ["Morristown,_New_Jersey"], "text": "Morristown , New Jersey"}, {"start": 2193, "end": 2232, "label": ["5724586"], "title": ["Forage_War"], "text": "protracted guerrilla conflict continued"}, {"start": 2338, "end": 2351, "label": ["163208"], "title": ["John_Burgoyne"], "text": "John Burgoyne"}, {"start": 2392, "end": 2411, "label": ["244245"], "title": ["George_Germain,_1st_Viscount_Sackville"], "text": "Lord George Germain"}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2472, "label": ["18201"], "title": ["Lake_Champlain"], "text": "Champlain"}, {"start": 2475, "end": 2481, "label": ["989428"], "title": ["Lake_George_(lake),_New_York"], "text": "George"}, {"start": 2484, "end": 2490, "label": ["47911"], "title": ["Hudson_River"], "text": "Hudson"}]}

Progress was slow ; the Americans blocked roads , destroyed bridges , dammed streams and denuded the area of food . Meanwhile , Barry St. Ledger 's diversionary column laid siege to Fort Stanwix . St. Ledger withdrew to Quebec on August 22 after his Indian support abandoned him . On August 16 , a foraging expedition was soundly defeated at Bennington , and more than 700 troops were captured . Meanwhile , the vast majority of Burgoyne 's Indian support abandoned him and Howe informed Burgoyne he would launch his campaign on Philadelphia as planned , and would be unable to render aid . Burgoyne decided to continue the advance . On September 19 , he attempted to flank the American position , and . The British won , but at the cost of 600 casualties . Burgoyne then dug in , but suffered a constant haemorrhage of deserters , and critical supplies were running low . On October 7 , a British reconnaissance in force against the American lines was . Burgoyne then withdrew with the Americans in pursuit , and by October 13 , he was surrounded . With no hope of relief and supplies exhausted , Burgoyne surrendered on October 17 , and 6,222 soldiers became prisoners of the Americans . The decisive success spurred France to enter the war as an ally of the United States , securing the final elements needed for victory over Britain , that of foreign assistance . Meanwhile , Howe launched his campaign against Washington , though his to bring him to battle in June 1777 failed . Howe declined to attack Philadelphia overland via New Jersey , or by sea via the Delaware Bay , even though both options would have enabled him to assist Burgoyne if necessary . Instead , he took his army on a time - consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay , leaving him completely unable to assist Burgoyne . This decision was so difficult to understand , Howe 's critics accused him of treason . Howe outflanked and defeated Washington on September 11 , though he failed to follow - up on the victory and destroy his army . A British victory at Willistown left Philadelphia defenceless , and Howe captured the city unopposed on September 26 . Howe then moved 9,000 men to Germantown , north of Philadelphia .

{"id": "12-5", "text": "Later , after several days of probing American defences at White Marsh , Howe inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia , astonishing both sides . Howe ignored the vulnerable American rear , where an attack could have deprived Washington of his baggage and supplies . On December 19 , Washington 's army entered winter quarters at Valley Forge . Poor conditions and supply problems resulted in the deaths of some 2,500 troops . Howe , only 20 miles ( 32 km ) away , made no effort to attack , which critics observed could have ended the war . The Continental Army was put through a new training program , supervised by Baron von Steuben , introducing the most modern Prussian methods of drilling . Meanwhile , Howe resigned and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24 , 1778 . Clinton received orders to abandon Philadelphia and fortify New York following France 's entry into the war . On June 18 , the British departed Philadelphia , with the reinvigorated Americans in pursuit . The two armies fought at Monmouth Court House on June 28 , with the Americans holding the field , greatly boosting morale and confidence . By July , both armies were back in the same positions they had been two years prior . The defeat at Saratoga caused considerable anxiety in Britain over foreign intervention . The North ministry sought reconciliation with the colonies by consenting to their original demands , although Lord North refused to grant independence . No positive reply was received from the Americans . French foreign minister the Comte de Vergennes was strongly anti - British , and he sought a pretext for going to war with Britain following the conquest of Canada in 1763 . The French had covertly supplied the Americans through neutral Dutch ports since the onset of the war , proving invaluable throughout the Saratoga campaign . The French public favored war , though Vergennes and King Louis XVI were hesitant , owing to the military and financial risk . The American victory at Saratoga convinced the French that supporting the Patriots was worthwhile , but doing so also brought major concerns . The King was concerned that Britain 's concessions would be accepted , and that Britain would then reconcile with the Colonies to strike at French and Spanish possessions in the Caribbean . To prevent this , France formally recognized the United States on February 6 , 1778 , and followed with a military alliance . France aimed to expel Britain from the Newfoundland fishery , end restrictions on Dunkirk sovereignty , regain free trade in India , recover Senegal and Dominica , and restore the Treaty of Utrecht provisions pertaining to Anglo - French trade . The first countries to recognize the United States were France on February 6 , 1778 and the Netherlands on April 19 , 1782 .", "entities": [{"start": 14, "end": 37, "label": ["7098174"], "title": ["Battle_of_White_Marsh"], "text": "several days of probing"}, {"start": 336, "end": 348, "label": ["10778278"], "title": ["Valley_Forge"], "text": "Valley Forge"}, {"start": 624, "end": 641, "label": ["93561"], "title": ["Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Steuben"], "text": "Baron von Steuben"}, {"start": 672, "end": 680, "label": ["9098894"], "title": ["Prussian_Army"], "text": "Prussian"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1032, "label": ["241429"], "title": ["Battle_of_Monmouth"], "text": "fought at Monmouth Court House"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1320, "label": ["1118581"], "title": ["North_ministry"], "text": "North ministry"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1360, "label": ["22487403"], "title": ["Carlisle_Peace_Commission"], "text": "reconciliation with the colonies"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1422, "label": ["221325"], "title": ["Frederick_North,_Lord_North"], "text": "Lord North"}, {"start": 1535, "end": 1553, "label": ["148300"], "title": ["Charles_Gravier,_comte_de_Vergennes"], "text": "Comte de Vergennes"}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1670, "label": ["18420108"], "title": ["Conquest_of_New_France_(1758–1760)"], "text": "conquest of Canada"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1713, "label": ["20838778"], "title": ["Roderigue_Hortalez_and_Company"], "text": "covertly supplied"}, {"start": 1897, "end": 1906, "label": ["51271"], "title": ["Louis_XVI"], "text": "Louis XVI"}, {"start": 2324, "end": 2343, "label": ["7420045"], "title": ["Treaty_of_Amity_and_Commerce_(France–United_States)"], "text": "formally recognized"}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2422, "label": ["193597"], "title": ["Treaty_of_Alliance_(1778)"], "text": "military alliance"}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2622, "label": ["180936"], "title": ["Peace_of_Utrecht"], "text": "Treaty of Utrecht"}]}
{"id": "12-6", "text": ", Spain was wary of provoking war with Britain before being ready and opted to covertly supply the Patriots via its colonies in New Spain . Congress hoped to persuade Spain into an open alliance , so the first American Commission met with the Count of Aranda in 1776 . Spain was still reluctant to make an early commitment , owing to a lack of direct French involvement , the threat against their treasure fleets , and the possibility of war with Portugal , Spain 's neighbor and a close ally of Britain . However , Spain affirmed its desire to support the Americans the following year , hoping to weaken Britain 's empire . The Portuguese threat was neutralized in the Spanish – Portuguese War ( 1776–77 ) . On 12 April 1779 , Spain signed the Treaty of Aranjuez with France and went to war against Britain . Spain sought to recover Gibraltar and Menorca in Europe , as well as Mobile and Pensacola in Florida , and also to expel the British from Central America . Meanwhile , George III had given up on subduing America while Britain had a European war to fight . He did not welcome war with France , but he believed that Britain had made all necessary steps to avoid it and cited the British victories over France in the Seven Years ' War as a reason to remain optimistic . Britain tried in vain to find a powerful ally to engage France , leaving it isolated , preventing Britain from focusing the majority of her efforts in one theater , and forcing a major diversion of military resources from America . Despite this , the King determined never to recognize American independence and to ravage the colonies indefinitely , or until they pleaded to return to the yoke of the Crown . Mahan argues that Britain 's attempt to fight in multiple theaters simultaneously without major allies was fundamentally flawed , citing impossible mutual support , exposing the forces to defeat in detail . Since the outbreak of the conflict , Britain had appealed to her ally , the neutral Dutch Republic , to lend her the use of the Scots Brigade for service in America , but pro - American sentiment among the Dutch public forced them to deny the request . Consequently , the British attempted to invoke several treaties for outright Dutch military support , but the Republic still refused . Moreover , American troops were being supplied with ordnance by Dutch merchants via their West Indies colonies . French supplies bound for America had also passed through Dutch ports . The Republic maintained free trade with France following France 's declaration of war on Britain , citing a prior concession by Britain on this issue . Britain responded by confiscating Dutch shipping , and even firing upon it .

Spain entered the war on April 12 , 1779 with a primary goal of capturing Gibraltar , and Spanish troops under the Duc de Crillon laid siege to the Rock on June 24 . The naval blockade , however , was relatively weak , and the British were able to resupply the garrison . Meanwhile , a plan was formulated for a combined Franco - Spanish invasion of the British mainland , but the expedition failed because of poor planning , disease , logistical issues , and high financial expenditures . However , a diversionary Franco - American squadron did meet with some success on September 23 under John Paul Jones . On 16 January 1780 , the Royal Navy under George Rodney scored a major victory over the Spanish , weakening the naval blockade of Gibraltar . A Franco - Spanish fleet commanded by Luis de Córdova intercepted and decisively defeated a large British convoy off the Azores led by John Moutray on August 9 which was bound for the West Indies . The defeat was catastrophic for Britain , which lost 52 merchant ships and five East Indiamen , as well as supplies and crews , making it one of the most complete naval captures ever made . The loss was valued at some £ 1.5 million ( £ in today 's money ) , dealing a severe blow to British commerce . The French blockaded the lucrative sugar islands of Barbados and Jamaica , intending to damage British trade . French troops led by the Marquis de Bouillé captured Dominica on September 7 , 1778 , in order to improve communication among French Caribbean islands and to strike a blow against privateering . The British defeated a French naval force on December 15 and captured St. Lucia on December 28 . Both fleets received reinforcements through the first half of 1779 , but the French under the Comte d'Estaing had superiority in the Caribbean and began capturing British territories , seizing St. Vincent on June 18 and Grenada on July 4 . The British fleet under John Byron was tactically defeated on July 6 , having pursued d'Estaing from Grenada , the worst loss that the Royal Navy had suffered since 1690 .

However , the British suffered terribly from disease and were forced to abandon the fort on November 29 , and Spanish troops subsequently reoccupied it .

The Company resolved to drive the French completely out of India , and they captured the Malabar port of Mahé in 1779 through which French ordnance passed . Mahé was under the protection of Mysore 's ruler Hyder Ali ( the Tipu Sultan ) , and tensions were already inflamed because the British had supported Malabar rebels who had risen against him ; so the fall of Mahé precipitated war . Hyder Ali invaded the Carnatic region in July 1780 and laid siege to Tellicherry and Arcot . A British relief force of 7,000 men under William Baille was intercepted and destroyed by the Tipu Sultan on 10 September , the worst defeat suffered by a European army in India at the time . Ali then renewed the siege at Arcot instead of pressing on for a decisive victory against a second British army at Madras , capturing it on 3 November . The delay allowed British forces to regroup for campaigning the following year .", "entities": [{"start": 85, "end": 110, "label": ["2638307"], "title": ["Battle_of_St._Louis"], "text": "British and Indian attack"}, {"start": 281, "end": 287, "label": ["2651664"], "title": ["Battle_of_Mobile_(1781)"], "text": "Mobile"}, {"start": 292, "end": 301, "label": ["2621352"], "title": ["Siege_of_Pensacola"], "text": "Pensacola"}, {"start": 341, "end": 353, "label": ["18635104"], "title": ["British_West_Florida"], "text": "West Florida"}, {"start": 598, "end": 607, "label": ["3821440"], "title": ["Captaincy_General_of_Guatemala"], "text": "Guatemala"}, {"start": 687, "end": 707, "label": ["339891"], "title": ["Omoa"], "text": "San Fernando de Omoa"}, {"start": 810, "end": 827, "label": ["3906625"], "title": ["William_Dalrymple_(British_Army_officer)"], "text": "William Dalrymple"}, {"start": 861, "end": 878, "label": ["22683002"], "title": ["Battle_of_San_Fernando_de_Omoa"], "text": "captured the fort"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1091, "label": ["10660733"], "title": ["John_Dalling"], "text": "John Dalling"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1158, "label": ["272915"], "title": ["Granada,_Nicaragua"], "text": "Granada"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1218, "label": ["2021732"], "title": ["San_Juan_River_(Nicaragua)"], "text": "San Juan River"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1241, "label": ["27989652"], "title": ["San_Juan_Expedition_(1780)"], "text": "expedition"}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1310, "label": ["24874360"], "title": ["Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson"], "text": "Horatio Nelson"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1339, "label": ["29427097"], "title": ["Fortress_of_the_Immaculate_Conception"], "text": "Fort San Juan"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1687, "label": ["43281"], "title": ["East_India_Company"], "text": "East India Company"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1792, "label": ["45154359"], "title": ["Anglo-French_War_(1778–1783)"], "text": "hostilities with France"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1820, "label": ["68143"], "title": ["Puducherry_(union_territory)"], "text": "Pondicherry"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1864, "label": ["23026600"], "title": ["Siege_of_Pondicherry_(1778)"], "text": "two - week siege"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1963, "label": ["30874446"], "title": ["Malabar_Coast"], "text": "Malabar"}, {"start": 1972, "end": 1976, "label": ["730058"], "title": ["Mahé,_India"], "text": "Mahé"}, {"start": 2057, "end": 2066, "label": ["938699"], "title": ["Kingdom_of_Mysore"], "text": "Mysore 's"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2082, "label": ["158512"], "title": ["Hyder_Ali"], "text": "Hyder Ali"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2100, "label": ["31058"], "title": ["Tipu_Sultan"], "text": "Tipu Sultan"}, {"start": 2237, "end": 2253, "label": ["1134334"], "title": ["Second_Anglo-Mysore_War"], "text": "precipitated war"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2293, "label": ["636251"], "title": ["Carnatic_region"], "text": "Carnatic region"}, {"start": 2311, "end": 2321, "label": ["30035478"], "title": ["Siege_of_Tellicherry"], "text": "laid siege"}, {"start": 2325, "end": 2336, "label": ["1235269"], "title": ["Thalassery"], "text": "Tellicherry"}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2346, "label": ["299068"], "title": ["Arcot,_Tamil_Nadu"], "text": "Arcot"}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2405, "label": ["30371724"], "title": ["William_Baillie_(East_India_Company_officer)"], "text": "William Baille"}, {"start": 2410, "end": 2435, "label": ["796655"], "title": ["Battle_of_Pollilur_(1780)"], "text": "intercepted and destroyed"}, {"start": 2656, "end": 2662, "label": ["45139"], "title": ["Chennai"], "text": "Madras"}]}

French admiral the Comte d'Estaing had been dispatched to America in April 1778 to assist Washington , and he arrived shortly after Clinton withdrew into New York . The Franco - American forces felt that New York 's defenses were too formidable for the French fleet , and they opted to attack Newport . This effort was launched on August 29 , but it failed when the French opted to withdraw , and this displeased the Americans . The war then ground down to a stalemate , with the majority of actions fought as large skirmishes , such as those at Chestnut Neck and Little Egg Harbor . In the summer of 1779 , the Americans captured British posts at Stony Point and Paulus Hook . In July , Clinton unsuccessfully attempted to coax Washington into a decisive engagement by making a major raid into Connecticut . That month , a large American naval operation attempted to retake Maine , but it resulted in the worst American naval defeat until Pearl Harbor in 1941 . The high frequency of compelled Washington to mount a punitive expedition which destroyed a large number of Iroquois settlements , but the effort ultimately failed to stop the raids . During the winter of 1779–80 , the Continental Army suffered greater hardships than at Valley Forge . Morale was poor , public support was being eroded by the long war , the national currency was virtually worthless , the army was plagued with supply problems , desertion was common , and whole regiments mutinied over the conditions in early 1780 . In 1780 , Clinton launched an attempt to retake New Jersey . On June 7 , 6,000 men invaded under Hessian general Wilhelm von Knyphausen , but they met stiff resistance from the local militia . The British held the field , but Knyphausen feared a general engagement with Washington 's main army and withdrew . Knyphausen and Clinton decided upon a second attempt two weeks later which was soundly defeated at Springfield , effectively ending British ambitions in New Jersey . Meanwhile , American general Benedict Arnold turned traitor and joined the British army , and he conspired to betray the key American fortress of West Point by surrendering it to the enemy . The plot was foiled when British spy master John André was captured , so Arnold fled to British lines in New York . He attempted to justify his betrayal by appealing to Loyalist public opinion , but the Patriots strongly condemned him as a coward and turncoat .

Later in the year , a second campaign was undertaken to seize the Illinois Country from the British . The Americans captured Kaskaskia on July 4 and then secured Vincennes , although Vincennes was recaptured by Henry Hamilton , the British commander at Detroit . In early 1779 , the Americans counter - attacked by undertaking a risky winter march , and they secured the surrender of the British at Vincennes , taking Hamilton prisoner . On May 25 , 1780 , the British launched an expedition into Kentucky as part of a wider operation to clear resistance from Quebec to the Gulf coast . The expedition met with only limited success , though hundreds of settlers were killed or captured . The Americans responded with a major offensive along the Mad River in August which met with some success , but it did little to abate the Indian raids on the frontier . French militia attempted to capture Detroit , but it ended in disaster when Miami Indians ambushed and defeated the gathered troops on November 5 . The war in the west had become a stalemate ; the Americans did not have the manpower to simultaneously defeat the hostile Indian tribes and occupy the land . The British turned their attention to conquering the South in 1778 after Loyalists in London assured them of a strong Loyalist base there . A southern campaign also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean , where it would be needed to defend lucrative colonies against the Franco - Spanish fleets . On December 29 , 1778 , an expeditionary corps from New York captured Savannah , and British troops then moved inland to recruit Loyalist support . There was a promising initial turnout in early 1779 , but then a large Loyalist militia was defeated at Kettle Creek on February 14 and they had to recognize their dependence upon the British . The British , however , defeated Patriot militia at Brier Creek on March 3 , and then launched an abortive assault on Charleston , South Carolina . The operation became notorious for its high degree of looting by British troops , enraging both Loyalists and Patriots . In October , a combined Franco - American effort failed to recapture Savannah . In May 1780 , Henry Clinton captured Charleston , taking over 5,000 prisoners and effectively destroying the Continental Army in the south .

The British launched a surprise offensive in Virginia in January 1781 , with Benedict Arnold invading Richmond , Virginia to little resistance . Governor Thomas Jefferson escaped Richmond just ahead of the British forces , and the British burned the city to the ground . Jefferson sent an emergency dispatch to Colonel Sampson Mathews whose militia was traveling nearby , to thwart Arnold 's efforts . Congress appointed Horatio Gates , victor at Saratoga , to lead the American effort in the south . He suffered a major defeat at Camden on August 16 , 1780 , setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina . The British attempted to subjugate the countryside , and Patriot militia continued to fight against them , so Cornwallis dispatched troops to raise Loyalist forces to cover his left flank as he moved north . This wing of Cornwallis ' army was virtually destroyed on October 7 , irreversibly breaking Loyalist support in the Carolinas . Cornwallis subsequently aborted his advance and retreated back into South Carolina . In the interim , Washington replaced Gates with his trusted subordinate Nathanael Greene . Greene was unable to confront the British directly , so he dispatched a force under Daniel Morgan to recruit additional troops . Morgan then defeated the cream of the British army under Tarleton on January 17 , 1781 at Cowpens . Cornwallis was criticized for having detached a substantial part of his army without adequate support , but he advanced into North Carolina despite the setbacks , gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support there . Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis , instead wearing the British down through a protracted war of attrition . By March , Greene 's army had increased in size enough that he felt confident in facing Cornwallis . The two armies engaged at Guilford Courthouse on March 15 ; Greene was beaten , but Cornwallis ' army suffered irreplaceable casualties . Compounding this , far fewer Loyalists were joining than the British had previously expected . Cornwallis ' casualties were such that he was compelled to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement , leaving the Patriots in control of the interior of the Carolinas and Georgia . Greene then proceeded to reclaim the South .

A British force clashed with American troops at Eutaw Springs on September 8 in a final effort to stop Greene , but the British casualties were so high that they withdrew to Charleston . Minor skirmishes continued in the Carolinas until the end of the war , and British troops were effectively confined to Charleston and Savannah for the remainder of the conflict . Cornwallis had discovered that the majority of American supplies in the Carolinas were passing through Virginia , and he had written to both Lord Germain and Clinton detailing his intentions to invade . Cornwallis believed that a successful campaign there would cut supplies to Greene 's army and precipitate a collapse of American resistance in the South . Clinton strongly opposed the plan , favoring a campaign farther north in the Chesapeake Bay region . Lord Germain wrote to Cornwallis to approve his plan and neglected to include Clinton in the decision - making , even though Clinton was Cornwallis ' superior officer , and Cornwallis then decided to move into Virginia without informing Clinton . Clinton , however , had failed to construct a coherent strategy for British operations in 1781 , owing to his difficult relationship with his naval counterpart Marriot Arbuthnot . Following the calamitous operations at Newport and Savannah , French planners realized that closer cooperation with the Americans was required to achieve success . The French fleet led by the Comte de Grasse had received discretionary orders from Paris to assist joint efforts in the north if naval support was needed . Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau discussed their options . Washington pushed for an attack on New York , while Rochambeau preferred a strike in Virginia , where the British were less well - established and thus easier to defeat . Franco - American movements around New York caused Clinton a great deal of anxiety , fearing an attack on the city . His instructions were vague to Cornwallis during this time , rarely forming explicit orders . However , Clinton did instruct Cornwallis to establish a fortified naval base and to transfer troops to the north to defend New York . Cornwallis dug in at Yorktown and awaited the Royal Navy . Washington still favored an assault on New York , but he acquiesced to the French when they opted to send their fleet to their preferred target of Yorktown .

On September 5 , the French fleet decisively defeated Graves , giving the French control of the seas around Yorktown and cutting off Cornwallis from reinforcements and relief . Despite the continued urging of his subordinates , Cornwallis made no attempt to break out and engage the Franco - American army before it had established siege works , expecting that reinforcements would arrive from New York , and the Franco - American army laid siege to Yorktown on September 28 . Cornwallis continued to think that relief was imminent from Clinton , and he abandoned his outer defenses which were immediately occupied by American troops — serving to hasten his subsequent defeat . The British then failed in an attempt to break out of the siege across the river at Gloucester Point when a storm hit . Cornwallis and his subordinates were under increasing bombardment and facing dwindling supplies ; they agreed that their situation was untenable and negotiated a surrender on October 17 , 1781 , and 7,685 soldiers became prisoners of the Americans . The same day as the surrender , 6,000 troops under Clinton had departed New York , sailing to relieve Yorktown . On 25 November 1781 , news arrived in London of the surrender at Yorktown . The Whig opposition gained traction in Parliament , and a motion was proposed on December 12 to end the war which was defeated by only one vote . On 27 February 1782 , the House voted against further war in America by 19 votes . Lord Germain was dismissed and a vote of no confidence was passed against North . The Rockingham Whigs came to power and opened negotiations for peace . Rockingham died and was succeeded by the Earl of Shelburne . Despite their defeat , the British still had 30,000 troops garrisoned in New York , Charleston , and Savannah . Henry Clinton was recalled and was replaced by Guy Carleton who was under orders to suspend offensive operations . After hostilities with the Dutch began in late 1780 , Britain had moved quickly , enforcing a blockade across the North Sea . Within weeks , the British had captured 200 Dutch merchantmen , and 300 more were holed up in foreign ports , though political turmoil within the Republic and peace negotiations by both sides helped keep conflict to a minimum . The majority of the Dutch public favored a military alliance with France against Britain ; however , the Dutch Stadtholder impeded these efforts , hoping to secure an early peace .

Frustrated in their attempts to capture Gibraltar , a Franco - Spanish force of 14,000 men under the Duc de Mahon invaded Minorca on 19 August .

On 7 February 1783 , after 1,322 days of siege , the Franco - Spanish army withdrew , decisively defeated . Sint Eustatius , a key supply port for the Patriots , was sacked by British forces under George Rodney on 3 February 1781 , who plundered the island 's wealth .

After the fall of Mobile to Spanish troops under Bernardo de Gálvez , an attempt to capture Pensacola was thwarted by a hurricane .

After re - grouping at Havana , Gálvez set out for Pensacola on 13 February . Arriving on 9 March , siege operations did not begin until 24 March , owing to difficulties in bringing the ships into the bay .

The Franco - Spanish plan to conquer Jamaica was in ruins , and the balance of naval power in the Caribbean shifted to the Royal Navy . In Guatemala , Matías de Gálvez led Spanish troops in an effort to dislocate British settlements along the Gulf of Honduras . Gálvez captured Roatán on 16 March 1782 , and then quickly took Black River . Following the decisive naval victory at the Saintes , Archibald Campbell , the Royal governor of Jamaica , authorized Edward Despard to re - take Black River , which he did on 22 August . However , with peace talks opening , and Franco - Spanish resources committed to the siege of Gibraltar , no further offensive operations took place . Following Dutch entry into the conflict , East India Company troops under Hector Munro captured the Dutch port of Negapatam after a three - week siege on 11 October 1781 . Soon after , British Admiral Edward Hughes captured Trincomalee after a brief engagement on 11 January 1782 . In March 1781 , French Admiral Bailli de Suffren was dispatched to India to assist colonial efforts . Suffren arrived off the Indian coast in February 1782 , where he clashed with a British fleet under Hughes , winning a narrow tactical victory . After landing troops at Porto Novo to assist Mysore , Suffren 's fleet clashed with Hughes again Providien on 12 April . There was no clear victor , though Hughes ' fleet came off worse , and he withdrew to the British - held port of Trincomalee . Hyder Ali wished for the French to capture Negapatam to establish naval dominance over the British , and this task fell to Suffren . Suffren 's fleet clashed with Hughes again off Negapatam on 6 July . Suffren withdrew to Cuddalore , strategically defeated , and the British remained in control of Negapatam . Intending to find a more suitable port than Cuddalore , Suffren captured Trincomalee on 1 September , and successfully engaged Hughes two days later . Meanwhile , Ali 's troops loosely blockaded Vellore as the East India Company regrouped . Company troops under Sir Eyre Coote led a counter - offensive , defeating Ali at Porto Novo on 1 July 1781 , Pollilur on 27 August , and Sholinghur on 27 September , expelling the Mysorean troops from the Carnatic .

He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara ( a region presently straddling eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan ) , to come to him and submit to his authority . Omphis ( Indian name Ambhi ) , the ruler of Taxila , whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes ( Jhelum ) , complied , but the chieftains of some hill clans , including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas ( known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas ) , refused to submit . Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents , placing himself and all his forces at his disposal . Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \" Persian robes , gold and silver ornaments , 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold \" . Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces , and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund , supplied their troops with provisions , and received Alexander himself , and his whole army , in his capital city of Taxila , with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality . On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king , Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River . After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus , to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms , but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy . Subsequently , however , the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander ; and Taxiles , after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes , was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus . A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip , son of Machatas ; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself ( 323 BC ) , as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus , 321 BC . In the winter of 327/326 BC , Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys , the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley , and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys .

{"id": "13-1", "text": "The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting , in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle . According to Curtius , \" Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga , but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble . \" A similar slaughter followed at Ora . In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora , numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos . Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill - fort after four bloody days . After Aornos , Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against King Porus , who ruled a region lying between the Hydaspes and the Acesines ( Chenab ) , in what is now the Punjab , in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC . Alexander was impressed by Porus ' bravery , and made him an ally . He appointed Porus as satrap , and added to Porus ' territory land that he did not previously own , towards the south - east , up to the Hyphasis ( Beas ) . Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece . Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the Hydaspes river , naming one Bucephala , in honour of his horse , who died around this time . The other was Nicaea ( Victory ) , thought to be located at the site of modern - day Mong , Punjab . Philostratus the Elder in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana writes that in the army of Porus there was an elephant who fought brave against Alexander 's army and Alexander dedicated it to the Helios ( Sun ) and named it Ajax , because he thought that a so great animal deserved a great name . The elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in Greek : \" Alexander the son of Zeus dedicates Ajax to the Helios \" ( ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ Ο ΔΙΟΣ ΤΟΝ ΑΙΑΝΤΑ ΤΩΙ ΗΛΙΩΙ ) . East of Porus ' kingdom , near the Ganges River , was the Nanda Empire of Magadha , and further east , the Gangaridai Empire of Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent . Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning , Alexander 's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River ( Beas ) , refusing to march farther east .

Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther , but his general Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return ; the men , he said , \" longed to again see their parents , their wives and children , their homeland \" . Alexander eventually agreed and turned south , marching along the Indus .

{"id": "14-0", "text": "Japanese animation began in the early 20th century , when Japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques also pioneered in France , Germany , the United States and Russia . A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin , an undated and private work by an unknown creator . In 1917 , the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear . Animators such as Ōten Shimokawa and Seitarou Kitayama produced numerous works , with the oldest surviving film being Kouchi 's Namakura Gatana , a two - minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target only to suffer defeat . The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake resulted in widespread destruction to Japan 's infrastructure and the destruction of Shimokawa 's warehouse , destroying most of these early works . By the 1930s animation was well established in Japan as an alternative format to the live - action industry . It suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators — like Noburō Ōfuji and Yasuji Murata — still worked in cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation . Other creators , Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo , nonetheless made great strides in animation technique ; they benefited from the patronage of the government , which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda . The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka , produced by Masaoka in 1933 . By 1940 , numerous anime artists ' organizations had risen , including the Shin Mangaha Shudan and Shin Nippon Mangaka . The first feature - length animated film was Momotaro 's Divine Sea Warriors directed by Seo in 1944 with sponsorship by the Imperial Japanese Navy . The success of The Walt Disney Company 's 1937 feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs profoundly influenced many Japanese animators . In the 1960s , manga artist and animator Osamu Tezuka adapted and simplified many Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and to limit the number of frames in productions . He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced animation staff . Three Tales , aired in 1960 , was the first anime shown on television . The first anime television series was Otogi Manga Calendar , aired from 1961 to 1964 . The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of manga , Japanese comic books and graphic novels , many of which were later animated . The work of Osamu Tezuka drew particular attention : he has been called a \" legend \" and the \" god of manga \" . His work — and that of other pioneers in the field — inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today .", "entities": [{"start": 67, "end": 77, "label": ["21554680"], "title": ["Film_director"], "text": "filmmakers"}, {"start": 236, "end": 251, "label": ["24982510"], "title": ["Katsudō_Shashin"], "text": "Katsudō Shashin"}, {"start": 404, "end": 418, "label": ["12745130"], "title": ["Ōten_Shimokawa"], "text": "Ōten Shimokawa"}, {"start": 423, "end": 440, "label": ["39873936"], "title": ["Seitarō_Kitayama"], "text": "Seitarou Kitayama"}, {"start": 514, "end": 529, "label": ["26182624"], "title": ["The_Dull_Sword"], "text": "Namakura Gatana"}, {"start": 634, "end": 661, "label": ["314097"], "title": ["1923_Great_Kantō_earthquake"], "text": "1923 Great Kantō earthquake"}, {"start": 994, "end": 1006, "label": ["23247356"], "title": ["Noburō_Ōfuji"], "text": "Noburō Ōfuji"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1024, "label": ["25403492"], "title": ["Yasuji_Murata"], "text": "Yasuji Murata"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1067, "label": ["745626"], "title": ["Cutout_animation"], "text": "cutout animation"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1093, "label": ["498464"], "title": ["Traditional_animation"], "text": "cel animation"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1126, "label": ["22497896"], "title": ["Kenzō_Masaoka"], "text": "Kenzō Masaoka"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1142, "label": ["25346256"], "title": ["Mitsuyo_Seo"], "text": "Mitsuyo Seo"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1324, "label": ["5934518"], "title": ["Propaganda_in_Japan_during_the_Second_Sino-Japanese_War_and_World_War_II"], "text": "propaganda"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1343, "label": ["70318"], "title": ["Sound_film"], "text": "talkie"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1383, "label": ["22878285"], "title": ["Chikara_to_Onna_no_Yo_no_Naka"], "text": "Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1613, "label": ["5997268"], "title": ["Momotaro:_Sacred_Sailors"], "text": "Momotaro 's Divine Sea Warriors"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1684, "label": ["236104"], "title": ["Imperial_Japanese_Navy"], "text": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1725, "label": ["37398"], "title": ["The_Walt_Disney_Company"], "text": "The Walt Disney Company"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1778, "label": ["76361"], "title": ["Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film)"], "text": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1880, "label": ["321560"], "title": ["Osamu_Tezuka"], "text": "Osamu Tezuka"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2145, "label": ["8328334"], "title": ["Three_Tales_(film)"], "text": "Three Tales"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2264, "label": ["8322655"], "title": ["Instant_History"], "text": "Otogi Manga Calendar"}, {"start": 2346, "end": 2351, "label": ["18985"], "title": ["Manga"], "text": "manga"}, {"start": 2363, "end": 2374, "label": ["145443"], "title": ["Comics"], "text": "comic books"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2393, "label": ["102445"], "title": ["Graphic_novel"], "text": "graphic novels"}]}

{"id": "16-0", "text": "= = = Early life : 1899–1919=== Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in the flat above his parents ' leased grocer 's shop at 517 High Road , Leytonstone , on the outskirts of east London ( then part of Essex ) , the youngest of three children : William Daniel ( born 1890 ) , Ellen Kathleen ( \" Nellie \" ) ( 1892 ) , and Alfred Joseph ( 1899 ) . His parents , Emma Jane Hitchcock , née Whelan ( 1863–1942 ) , and William Edgar Hitchcock ( 1862–1914 ) , were both Roman Catholics , with partial roots in Ireland ; William was a greengrocer as his father had been . There was a large extended family , including Uncle John Hitchcock with his five - bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road , Putney , complete with maid , cook , chauffeur and gardener . Every summer John rented a seaside house for the family in Cliftonville , Kent . Hitchcock said that he first became class - conscious there , noticing the differences between tourists and locals . Describing himself as a well - behaved boy — his father called him his \" little lamb without a spot\"—Hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate . One of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five ; the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes , saying , \" This is what we do to naughty boys . \" The experience left him , he said , with a lifelong fear of policemen ; in 1973 he told Tom Snyder that he was \" scared stiff of anything ... to do with the law \" and would n't even drive a car in case he got a parking ticket . When he was six , the family moved to Limehouse and leased two stores at 130 and 175 Salmon Lane , which they ran as a fish - and - chips shop and fishmongers ' respectively ; they lived above the former . It seems that Hitchcock was seven when he attended his first school , the Howrah House Convent in Poplar , which he entered in 1907 . According to Patrick McGilligan , he stayed at Howrah House for at most two years . He also attended a convent school , the Wode Street School \" for the daughters of gentlemen and little boys \" , run by the Faithful Companions of Jesus ; briefly attended a primary school near his home ; and was for a very short time , when he was nine , a boarder at Salesian College in Battersea . The family moved again when he was 11 , this time to Stepney , and on 5 October 1910 Hitchcock was sent to St Ignatius College in Stamford Hill , Tottenham ( now in the London Borough of Haringey ) , a Jesuit grammar school with a reputation for discipline . The priests used a hard rubber cane on the boys , always at the end of the day , so the boys had to sit through classes anticipating the punishment once they knew they 'd been written up for it .", "entities": [{"start": 142, "end": 153, "label": ["240225"], "title": ["Leytonstone"], "text": "Leytonstone"}, {"start": 176, "end": 187, "label": ["1429635"], "title": ["East_London"], "text": "east London"}, {"start": 203, "end": 208, "label": ["40100758"], "title": ["Essex"], "text": "Essex"}, {"start": 464, "end": 479, "label": ["606848"], "title": ["Catholic_Church"], "text": "Roman Catholics"}, {"start": 528, "end": 539, "label": ["854986"], "title": ["Greengrocer"], "text": "greengrocer"}, {"start": 690, "end": 696, "label": ["94255"], "title": ["Putney"], "text": "Putney"}, {"start": 811, "end": 823, "label": ["6671268"], "title": ["Cliftonville"], "text": "Cliftonville"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1481, "label": ["931315"], "title": ["Tom_Snyder"], "text": "Tom Snyder"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1658, "label": ["94161"], "title": ["Limehouse"], "text": "Limehouse"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1748, "label": ["46173"], "title": ["Fish_and_chips"], "text": "fish - and - chips"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1921, "label": ["94247"], "title": ["Poplar,_London"], "text": "Poplar"}, {"start": 1964, "end": 1982, "label": ["27753686"], "title": ["Patrick_McGilligan_(biographer)"], "text": "Patrick McGilligan"}, {"start": 2158, "end": 2186, "label": ["3041423"], "title": ["Faithful_Companions_of_Jesus"], "text": "Faithful Companions of Jesus"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2319, "label": ["3841267"], "title": ["Salesian_College,_Battersea"], "text": "Salesian College"}, {"start": 2323, "end": 2332, "label": ["93865"], "title": ["Battersea"], "text": "Battersea"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2395, "label": ["94299"], "title": ["Stepney"], "text": "Stepney"}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2461, "label": ["1777863"], "title": ["St_Ignatius'_College"], "text": "St Ignatius College"}, {"start": 2537, "end": 2543, "label": ["16083"], "title": ["Jesuits"], "text": "Jesuit"}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2558, "label": ["156975"], "title": ["Grammar_school"], "text": "grammar school"}]}

The school register lists his year of birth as 1900 rather than 1899 ; Spoto writes that it seems he was deliberately enrolled as a 10 - year - old , perhaps because he was a year behind with his schooling . While biographer Gene Adair reports that Hitchcock was \" an average , or slightly above - average , pupil \" , Hitchcock said he was \" usually among the four or five at the top of the class \" ; at the end of his first year , his work in Latin , English , French and religious education was noted . His favourite subject was geography , and he became interested in maps , and railway and bus timetables ; according to Taylor , he could recite all the stops on the Orient Express . He told Peter Bogdanovich : \" The Jesuits taught me organization , control and , to some degree , analysis . \" Hitchcock told his parents that he wanted to be an engineer , and on 25 July 1913 , he left St Ignatius and enrolled in night classes at the London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation in Poplar .

Then on 12 December 1914 his father , who had been suffering from emphysema and kidney disease , died at the age of 52 . To support himself and his mother — his older siblings had left home by then — Hitchcock took a job , for 15 shillings a week ( £ in 2017 ) , as a technical clerk at the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company in Blomfield Street near London Wall .

Donald Spoto writes that most of the staff were Americans with strict job specifications , but the English workers were encouraged to try their hand at anything , which meant that Hitchcock gained experience as a co - writer , art director and production manager on at least 18 silent films . The Times wrote in February 1922 about the studio 's \" special art title department under the supervision of Mr. A. J. Hitchcock \" . His work there included Number 13 ( 1922 ) , also known as Mrs. Peabody , cancelled because of financial problems — the few finished scenes are lost — and Always Tell Your Wife ( 1923 ) , which he and Seymour Hicks finished together when Hicks was about to give up on it . Hicks wrote later about being helped by \" a fat youth who was in charge of the property room ... [ n]one other than Alfred Hitchcock \" . When Paramount pulled out of London in 1922 , Hitchcock was hired as an assistant director by a new firm run in the same location by Michael Balcon , later known as Gainsborough Pictures . Hitchcock worked on Woman to Woman ( 1923 ) with the director Graham Cutts , designing the set , writing the script and producing . He said : \" It was the first film that I had really got my hands onto . \" The editor and \" script girl \" on Woman to Woman was Alma Reville , his future wife . He also worked as an assistant to Cutts on The White Shadow ( 1924 ) , The Passionate Adventure ( 1924 ) , The Blackguard ( 1925 ) , and The Prude 's Fall ( 1925 ) . The Blackguard was produced at the Babelsberg Studios in Potsdam , where Hitchcock watched part of the making of F. W. Murnau 's film The Last Laugh ( 1924 ) . He was impressed with Murnau 's work and later used many of his techniques for the set design in his own productions .", "entities": [{"start": 400, "end": 415, "label": ["5142"], "title": ["Charlie_Chaplin"], "text": "Charlie Chaplin"}, {"start": 418, "end": 432, "label": ["7888"], "title": ["D._W._Griffith"], "text": "D.

{"id": "16-3", "text": "In the summer of 1925 , Balcon asked Hitchcock to direct The Pleasure Garden ( 1925 ) , starring Virginia Valli , a co - production of Gainsborough and the German firm Emelka at the Geiselgasteig studio near Munich . Reville , by then Hitchcock 's fiancée , was assistant director - editor . Although the film was a commercial flop , Balcon liked Hitchcock 's work ; a Daily Express headline called him the \" Young man with a master mind \" . Balcon asked him to direct a second film in Munich , The Mountain Eagle ( 1926 ) , based on an original story titled Fear o ' God . The film is lost ; Hitchcock called it \" a very bad movie \" . Hitchcock 's luck changed with his first thriller , The Lodger : A Story of the London Fog ( 1927 ) , about the hunt for a serial killer who , wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag , is murdering young blonde women in London , and only on Tuesdays . A landlady suspects that her lodger is the killer , but he turns out to be innocent . To convey the impression footsteps were being heard from an upper floor , Hitchcock had a glass floor made so that the audience could see the lodger pacing up and down in his room above the landlady . Hitchcock had wanted the leading man to be guilty , or for the film at least to end ambiguously , but the star was Ivor Novello , a matinée idol , and the \" star system \" meant that Novello could not be the villain . Hitchcock told Truffaut : \" You have to clearly spell it out in big letters : ' He is innocent . ' \" ( He had the same problem years later with Cary Grant in ( 1941 ) . ) Released in January 1927 , The Lodger was a commercial and critical success in the UK . Hitchcock told Truffaut that the film was the first of his to be influenced by the Expressionist techniques he had witnessed in Germany : \" In truth , you might almost say that The Lodger was my first picture . \" He made his first cameo appearance in the film because an extra was needed , and was depicted sitting in a newsroom . A second appearance , standing in a crowd as the leading man is arrested , is in doubt . On 2 December 1926 , Hitchcock married the English - American screenwriter Alma Reville ( 1899–1982 ) at the Brompton Oratory in South Kensington . The couple honeymooned in Paris , Lake Como and St. Moritz , before returning to London to live in a leased flat on the top two floors of 153 Cromwell Road , Kensington . Reville , who was born just hours after Hitchcock , converted from Protestantism to Catholicism , apparently at the insistence of Hitchcock 's mother ; she was baptized on 31 May 1927 and confirmed at Westminster Cathedral by Cardinal Francis Bourne on 5 June .", "entities": [{"start": 57, "end": 76, "label": ["940668"], "title": ["The_Pleasure_Garden_(1925_film)"], "text": "The Pleasure Garden"}, {"start": 97, "end": 111, "label": ["6834934"], "title": ["Virginia_Valli"], "text": "Virginia Valli"}, {"start": 168, "end": 174, "label": ["5786446"], "title": ["Bavaria_Film"], "text": "Emelka"}, {"start": 495, "end": 513, "label": ["916546"], "title": ["The_Mountain_Eagle"], "text": "The Mountain Eagle"}, {"start": 586, "end": 590, "label": ["2044294"], "title": ["Lost_film"], "text": "lost"}, {"start": 688, "end": 726, "label": ["287408"], "title": ["The_Lodger:_A_Story_of_the_London_Fog"], "text": "The Lodger : A Story of the London Fog"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1309, "label": ["47154"], "title": ["Ivor_Novello"], "text": "Ivor Novello"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1326, "label": ["5139737"], "title": ["Matinée_idol"], "text": "matinée idol"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1350, "label": ["2421143"], "title": ["Star_system_(filmmaking)"], "text": "star system"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1553, "label": ["38965"], "title": ["Cary_Grant"], "text": "Cary Grant"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1754, "label": ["1046537"], "title": ["German_Expressionism_(cinema)"], "text": "Expressionist"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2165, "label": ["217420"], "title": ["Alma_Reville"], "text": "Alma Reville"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2203, "label": ["2684636"], "title": ["Brompton_Oratory"], "text": "Brompton Oratory"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2223, "label": ["542549"], "title": ["South_Kensington"], "text": "South Kensington"}, {"start": 2260, "end": 2269, "label": ["250437"], "title": ["Lake_Como"], "text": "Lake Como"}, {"start": 2368, "end": 2381, "label": ["413529"], "title": ["Cromwell_Road"], "text": "Cromwell Road"}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2619, "label": ["391897"], "title": ["Westminster_Cathedral"], "text": "Westminster Cathedral"}, {"start": 2632, "end": 2646, "label": ["6758813"], "title": ["Francis_Bourne"], "text": "Francis Bourne"}]}

Their daughter and only child , Patricia Alma Hitchcock , was born on 7 July that year . Reville became her husband 's closest collaborator ; Charles Champlin wrote in 1982 : \" The Hitchcock touch had four hands , and two were Alma 's . \" . When Hitchcock accepted the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 , he said he wanted to mention \" four people who have given me the most affection , appreciation and encouragement , and constant collaboration . The first of the four is a film editor , the second is a scriptwriter , the third is the mother of my daughter , Pat , and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen . And their names are Alma Reville \" . Reville wrote or co - wrote on many of Hitchcock 's films , including Shadow of a Doubt , Suspicion ( 1941 film ) and The 39 Steps ( 1935 film ) . Hitchcock began work on his tenth film , Blackmail ( 1929 ) , when its production company , British International Pictures ( BIP ) , converted its Elstree studios to sound . The film was the first British \" \" ; it followed the first American sound feature film , The Jazz Singer ( 1927 ) . Blackmail began the Hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as a backdrop for suspense sequences , with the climax taking place on the dome of the British Museum . It also features one of his longest cameo appearances , which shows him being bothered by a small boy as he reads a book on the London Underground . In the PBS series The Men Who Made The Movies , Hitchcock explained how he used early sound recording as a special element of the film , stressing the word \" knife \" in a conversation with the woman suspected of murder . During this period , Hitchcock directed segments for a BIP revue , Elstree Calling ( 1930 ) , and directed a short film , An Elastic Affair ( 1930 ) , featuring two Film Weekly scholarship winners . An Elastic Affair is one of the lost films . In 1933 Hitchcock was once again working for Michael Balcon at Gaumont - British . His first film for the company , The Man Who Knew Too Much ( 1934 ) , was a success ; his second , The 39 Steps ( 1935 ) , was acclaimed in the UK and made Hitchcock a star in the US . It also established the quintessential English \" Hitchcock blonde \" ( Madeleine Carroll ) as the template for his succession of ice - cold , elegant leading ladies .

{"id": "16-5", "text": "This film was one of the first to introduce the \" MacGuffin \" plot device , a term coined by the English screenwriter Angus MacPhail . The MacGuffin is an item or goal the protagonist is pursuing , one that otherwise has no narrative value ; in The 39 Steps , the MacGuffin is a stolen set of design plans . Hitchcock released two spy thrillers in 1936 . Sabotage was loosely based on Joseph Conrad 's novel , The Secret Agent ( 1907 ) , about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist , and Secret Agent , based on two stories in Ashenden : Or the British Agent ( 1928 ) by W. Somerset Maugham . At this time , Hitchcock also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew . These jokes ranged from simple and innocent to crazy and maniacal . For instance , he hosted a dinner party where he dyed all the food blue because , as he claimed , there were n't enough blue foods . He also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of his friend , actor Sir Gerald du Maurier . Hitchcock 's next major success was The Lady Vanishes ( 1938 ) , \" one of the greatest train movies from the genre 's golden era \" , according to Philip French , in which Miss Froy ( May Whitty ) , a British spy posing as a governess , disappears on a train journey through the fictional European country of Bandrika . The film saw Hitchcock receive the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director , the only time he won an award for his direction . Benjamin Crisler , the New York Times film critic , wrote in June 1938 : \" Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not : Magna Carta , the Tower Bridge and Alfred Hitchcock , the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world . \" David O. Selznick signed Hitchcock to a seven - year contract beginning in March 1939 , and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood . In June that year Life magazine called him the \" greatest master of melodrama in screen history \" . The working arrangements with Selznick were less than ideal . Selznick suffered from constant financial problems , and Hitchcock was often unhappy about Selznick 's creative control over his films . In a later interview , Hitchcock said : \" [ Selznick ] was the Big Producer . ... Producer was king . The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me — and it shows you the amount of control — he said I was the ' only director ' he 'd ' trust with a film ' . \" At the same time , Selznick complained about Hitchcock 's \" goddamn jigsaw cutting \" , which meant that the producer had to follow Hitchcock 's vision of the finished product .

{"id": "16-6", "text": "Selznick made only a few films each year , as did fellow independent producer Samuel Goldwyn , so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct . Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract , only to be outbid by Selznick . Hitchcock was quickly impressed by the superior resources of the American studios compared to the financial limits he had often faced in Britain . The Selznick picture Rebecca ( 1940 ) was Hitchcock 's first American film , set in a Hollywood version of England 's Cornwall and based on a novel by English novelist Daphne du Maurier . The film stars Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine . The story concerns a naïve ( and unnamed ) young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat . She goes to live in his huge English country house , and struggles with the lingering reputation of his elegant and worldly first wife Rebecca , who died under mysterious circumstances . The film won Best Picture at the 13th Academy Awards ; the statuette was given to Selznick , as the film 's producer . Hitchcock was nominated for Best Director , his first of five such nominations . Hitchcock 's second American film was the thriller Foreign Correspondent ( 1940 ) , set in Europe , based on Vincent Sheean 's book Personal History ( 1935 ) and produced by Walter Wanger . It was nominated for Best Picture that year . Hitchcock felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while his country was at war ; his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the British war effort . Filmed in the first year of the Second World War , it was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe , as covered by an American newspaper reporter played by Joel McCrea . Mixing footage of European scenes with scenes filmed on a Hollywood backlot , the film avoided direct references to Nazism , Nazi Germany , and Germans to comply with Hollywood 's Motion Picture Production Code censorship at the time . In September 1940 the Hitchcocks bought the Cornwall Ranch near Scotts Valley , California , in the Santa Cruz Mountains . Their primary residence was an English - style home in Bel Air , purchased in 1942 . Hitchcock 's films were diverse during this period , ranging from the romantic comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith ( 1941 ) to the bleak film noir Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) . Suspicion ( 1941 ) marked Hitchcock 's first film as a producer and director . It is set in England ; Hitchcock used the north coast of Santa Cruz for the English coastline sequence . The film is the first of four projects on which Cary Grant worked with Hitchcock , and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role .", "entities": [{"start": 78, "end": 92, "label": ["390766"], "title": ["Samuel_Goldwyn"], "text": "Samuel Goldwyn"}, {"start": 424, "end": 431, "label": ["1259785"], "title": ["Rebecca_(1940_film)"], "text": "Rebecca"}, {"start": 571, "end": 588, "label": ["66877"], "title": ["Daphne_du_Maurier"], "text": "Daphne du Maurier"}, {"start": 606, "end": 622, "label": ["43675"], "title": ["Laurence_Olivier"], "text": "Laurence Olivier"}, {"start": 627, "end": 640, "label": ["180982"], "title": ["Joan_Fontaine"], "text": "Joan Fontaine"}, {"start": 762, "end": 783, "label": ["1312933"], "title": ["English_country_house"], "text": "English country house"}, {"start": 933, "end": 945, "label": ["61702"], "title": ["Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture"], "text": "Best Picture"}, {"start": 953, "end": 972, "label": ["6234991"], "title": ["13th_Academy_Awards"], "text": "13th Academy Awards"}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1080, "label": ["62009"], "title": ["Academy_Award_for_Best_Director"], "text": "Best Director"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1192, "label": ["62688"], "title": ["Foreign_Correspondent_(film)"], "text": "Foreign Correspondent"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1243, "label": ["8613601"], "title": ["Vincent_Sheean"], "text": "Vincent Sheean"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1307, "label": ["2945818"], "title": ["Walter_Wanger"], "text": "Walter Wanger"}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1568, "label": ["32927"], "title": ["World_War_II"], "text": "Second World War"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1696, "label": ["537253"], "title": ["Joel_McCrea"], "text": "Joel McCrea"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1821, "label": ["31045316"], "title": ["Nazism"], "text": "Nazism"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1836, "label": ["21212"], "title": ["Nazi_Germany"], "text": "Nazi Germany"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1850, "label": ["152735"], "title": ["Germans"], "text": "Germans"}, {"start": 1879, "end": 1909, "label": ["167816"], "title": ["Hays_Code"], "text": "Motion Picture Production Code"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2012, "label": ["108183"], "title": ["Scotts_Valley,_California"], "text": "Scotts Valley"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2055, "label": ["206763"], "title": ["Santa_Cruz_Mountains"], "text": "Santa Cruz Mountains"}, {"start": 2229, "end": 2245, "label": ["1571083"], "title": ["Mr._&_Mrs._Smith_(1941_film)"], "text": "Mr. & Mrs. Smith"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2277, "label": ["10802"], "title": ["Film_noir"], "text": "film noir"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2295, "label": ["76339"], "title": ["Shadow_of_a_Doubt"], "text": "Shadow of a Doubt"}, {"start": 2307, "end": 2316, "label": ["74984"], "title": ["Suspicion_(1941_film)"], "text": "Suspicion"}, {"start": 2443, "end": 2453, "label": ["81726"], "title": ["Santa_Cruz,_California"], "text": "Santa Cruz"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2549, "label": ["38965"], "title": ["Cary_Grant"], "text": "Cary Grant"}]}
{"id": "16-7", "text": "Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth , an English con man whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife , Lina McLaidlaw ( Joan Fontaine ) . In one scene Hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk , perhaps poisoned , that Grant is bringing to his wife ; the light makes sure that the audience 's attention is on the glass . Grant 's character is a killer in the book on which the film was based , Before the Fact by Francis Iles , but the studio felt that Grant 's image would be tarnished by that . Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale , although , as he told François Truffaut , he would have preferred to end with the wife 's murder . Fontaine won Best Actress for her performance . Saboteur ( 1942 ) is the first of two films that Hitchcock made for Universal during the decade . Hitchcock was forced by Universal Studios to use Universal contract player Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane , a freelancer who signed a one - picture deal with Universal , both known for their work in comedies and light dramas . Breaking with Hollywood conventions of the time , Hitchcock did extensive location filming , especially in New York City , and depicted a confrontation between a suspected saboteur ( Cummings ) and a real saboteur ( Norman Lloyd ) atop the Statue of Liberty . He also directed Have You Heard ? ( 1942 ) , a photographic dramatisation for Life magazine of the dangers of rumours during wartime . In 1943 he wrote a mystery story for Look magazine , \" The Murder of Monty Woolley \" , a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to find clues to the murderer 's identity ; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves , such as Woolley , Doris Merrick , and make - up man Guy Pearce . Shadow of a Doubt ( 1943 ) was Hitchcock 's personal favourite and the second of the early Universal films . Charlotte \" Charlie \" Newton ( Teresa Wright ) suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley ( Joseph Cotten ) of being a serial killer . Hitchcock again filmed extensively on location , this time in the Northern California city of Santa Rosa . Working at 20th Century Fox , Hitchcock approached John Steinbeck with an idea for a film , which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German U - boat attack . Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film Lifeboat ( 1944 ) . However , Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits , to no avail . The idea was rewritten as a short story by Harry Sylvester and published in Collier 's in 1943 . The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank . The locale posed problems for Hitchcock 's traditional cameo appearance .", "entities": [{"start": 42, "end": 49, "label": ["96637"], "title": ["Confidence_trick"], "text": "con man"}, {"start": 141, "end": 154, "label": ["180982"], "title": ["Joan_Fontaine"], "text": "Joan Fontaine"}, {"start": 421, "end": 436, "label": ["5385291"], "title": ["Before_the_Fact"], "text": "Before the Fact"}, {"start": 440, "end": 452, "label": ["625048"], "title": ["Anthony_Berkeley_Cox"], "text": "Francis Iles"}, {"start": 690, "end": 702, "label": ["23245556"], "title": ["Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress"], "text": "Best Actress"}, {"start": 725, "end": 733, "label": ["1576720"], "title": ["Saboteur_(film)"], "text": "Saboteur"}, {"start": 793, "end": 802, "label": ["170326"], "title": ["Universal_Pictures"], "text": "Universal"}, {"start": 898, "end": 913, "label": ["1298267"], "title": ["Robert_Cummings"], "text": "Robert Cummings"}, {"start": 918, "end": 932, "label": ["35028792"], "title": ["Priscilla_Lane"], "text": "Priscilla Lane"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1282, "label": ["6149297"], "title": ["Norman_Lloyd"], "text": "Norman Lloyd"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1311, "label": ["28617"], "title": ["Statue_of_Liberty"], "text": "Statue of Liberty"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1396, "label": ["187479"], "title": ["Life_(magazine)"], "text": "Life"}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1446, "label": ["16993699"], "title": ["Loose_lips_sink_ships"], "text": "dangers of rumours during wartime"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1490, "label": ["5557770"], "title": ["Look_(American_magazine)"], "text": "Look"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1531, "label": ["145645"], "title": ["Monty_Woolley"], "text": "Monty Woolley"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1764, "label": ["76339"], "title": ["Shadow_of_a_Doubt"], "text": "Shadow of a Doubt"}, {"start": 1887, "end": 1900, "label": ["181011"], "title": ["Teresa_Wright"], "text": "Teresa Wright"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1960, "label": ["16219"], "title": ["Joseph_Cotten"], "text": "Joseph Cotten"}, {"start": 2084, "end": 2094, "label": ["108243"], "title": ["Santa_Rosa,_California"], "text": "Santa Rosa"}, {"start": 2108, "end": 2124, "label": ["170318"], "title": ["20th_Century_Studios"], "text": "20th Century Fox"}, {"start": 2148, "end": 2162, "label": ["15825"], "title": ["John_Steinbeck"], "text": "John Steinbeck"}, {"start": 2335, "end": 2343, "label": ["264869"], "title": ["Lifeboat_(1944_film)"], "text": "Lifeboat"}, {"start": 2512, "end": 2527, "label": ["9505869"], "title": ["Harry_Sylvester"], "text": "Harry Sylvester"}, {"start": 2545, "end": 2555, "label": ["401663"], "title": ["Collier's"], "text": "Collier 's"}]}
{"id": "16-8", "text": "That was solved by having Hitchcock 's image appear in a newspaper that William Bendix is reading in the boat , showing the director in a before - and - after advertisement for \" Reduco - Obesity Slayer \" . He told Truffaut in 1962 : Hitchcock 's typical dinner before the weight loss had been a roast chicken , boiled ham , potatoes , bread , vegetables , relishes , salad , dessert , a bottle of wine and some brandy . To lose weight , he stopped drinking , drank black coffee for breakfast and lunch , and ate steak and salad for dinner , but it was hard to maintain ; Spoto writes that his weight fluctuated considerably over the next 40 years . At the end of 1943 , despite the weight loss , the Occidental Insurance Company of Los Angeles refused him life insurance . Hitchcock returned to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944 . While there he made two short propaganda films , Bon Voyage ( 1944 ) and Aventure Malgache ( 1944 ) , for the Ministry of Information . In June and July 1945 Hitchcock served as \" treatment advisor \" on a Holocaust documentary that used Allied Forces footage of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps . The film was assembled in London and produced by Sidney Bernstein of the Ministry of Information , who brought Hitchcock ( a friend of his ) on board . It was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans , but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post - war population . Instead , it was transferred in 1952 from the British War Office film vaults to London 's Imperial War Museum and remained unreleased until 1985 , when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of PBS Frontline , under the title the Imperial War Museum had given it : Memory of the Camps . The full - length version of the film , German Concentration Camps Factual Survey , was restored in 2014 by scholars at the Imperial War Museum . Hitchcock worked for David Selznick again when he directed Spellbound ( 1945 ) , which explores psychoanalysis and features a dream sequence designed by Salvador Dalí . The dream sequence as it appears in the film is ten minutes shorter than was originally envisioned ; Selznick edited it to make it \" play \" more effectively . Gregory Peck plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson ( Ingrid Bergman ) , who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past . Two point - of - view shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand ( which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took ) and out - sized props for it to hold : a bucket - sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun .", "entities": [{"start": 72, "end": 86, "label": ["529315"], "title": ["William_Bendix"], "text": "William Bendix"}, {"start": 885, "end": 901, "label": ["23290"], "title": ["Propaganda_film"], "text": "propaganda films"}, {"start": 904, "end": 914, "label": ["3878392"], "title": ["Bon_Voyage_(1944_film)"], "text": "Bon Voyage"}, {"start": 928, "end": 945, "label": ["2075415"], "title": ["Aventure_Malgache"], "text": "Aventure Malgache"}, {"start": 965, "end": 988, "label": ["1190694"], "title": ["Ministry_of_Information_(United_Kingdom)"], "text": "Ministry of Information"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1069, "label": ["10396793"], "title": ["The_Holocaust"], "text": "Holocaust"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1159, "label": ["514725"], "title": ["Nazi_concentration_camps"], "text": "Nazi concentration camps"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1227, "label": ["8812595"], "title": ["Sidney_Bernstein,_Baron_Bernstein"], "text": "Sidney Bernstein"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1538, "label": ["274472"], "title": ["War_Office"], "text": "British War Office"}, {"start": 1564, "end": 1583, "label": ["187432"], "title": ["Imperial_War_Museum"], "text": "Imperial War Museum"}, {"start": 1675, "end": 1678, "label": ["29697498"], "title": ["PBS"], "text": "PBS"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1688, "label": ["235262"], "title": ["Frontline_(American_TV_program)"], "text": "Frontline"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1849, "label": ["45004186"], "title": ["German_Concentration_Camps_Factual_Survey"], "text": "German Concentration Camps Factual Survey"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1983, "label": ["80488"], "title": ["Spellbound_(1945_film)"], "text": "Spellbound"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2024, "label": ["23585"], "title": ["Psychoanalysis"], "text": "psychoanalysis"}, {"start": 2040, "end": 2054, "label": ["1903488"], "title": ["Dream_sequence"], "text": "dream sequence"}, {"start": 2067, "end": 2080, "label": ["40112"], "title": ["Salvador_Dalí"], "text": "Salvador Dalí"}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2254, "label": ["77491"], "title": ["Gregory_Peck"], "text": "Gregory Peck"}, {"start": 2337, "end": 2351, "label": ["41562"], "title": ["Ingrid_Bergman"], "text": "Ingrid Bergman"}]}
{"id": "16-9", "text": "For added novelty and impact , the climactic gunshot was hand - coloured red on some copies of the black - and - white film . The original musical score by Miklós Rózsa makes use of the theremin , and some of it was later adapted by the composer into Rozsa 's Piano Concerto Op . 31 ( 1967 ) for piano and orchestra . Notorious ( 1946 ) followed Spellbound . Hitchcock told François Truffaut that Selznick had sold him , Ingrid Bergman , Cary Grant , and the screenplay by Ben Hecht , to RKO Radio Pictures as a \" package \" for $ 500,000 ( ) because of cost overruns on Selznick 's Duel in the Sun ( 1946 ) . Notorious stars Bergman and Grant , both Hitchcock regulars , and features a plot about Nazis , uranium and South America . His prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to him being briefly placed under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . According to McGilligan , in or around March 1945 Hitchcock and Ben Hecht consulted Robert Millikan of the California Institute of Technology about the development of a uranium bomb . Selznick complained that the notion was \" science fiction \" , only to be confronted by the news of the detonation of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in August 1945 . Hitchcock formed an independent production company , Transatlantic Pictures , with his friend Sidney Bernstein . He made two films with Transatlantic , one of which was his first colour film . With Rope ( 1948 ) , Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment , as he had done earlier with Lifeboat ( 1944 ) . The film appears to have been shot in a single take , but it was actually shot in 10 takes ranging from 4- to 10 minutes each ; a 10 - minute length of film was the most that a camera 's film magazine could hold at the time . Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment . Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut , and began the next take with the camera in the same place . The film features James Stewart in the leading role , and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock . It was inspired by the Leopold and Loeb case of the 1920s . The film was not well received . Under Capricorn ( 1949 ) , set in 19th - century Australia , also uses the short - lived technique of long takes , but to a more limited extent . He again used Technicolor in this production , then returned to black - and - white films for several years . Transatlantic Pictures became inactive after these two unsuccessful films . Hitchcock filmed Stage Fright ( 1950 ) at studios in Elstree , England , where he had worked during his British International Pictures contract many years before .", "entities": [{"start": 156, "end": 168, "label": ["609081"], "title": ["Miklós_Rózsa"], "text": "Miklós Rózsa"}, {"start": 186, "end": 194, "label": ["30722"], "title": ["Theremin"], "text": "theremin"}, {"start": 318, "end": 327, "label": ["255198"], "title": ["Notorious_(1946_film)"], "text": "Notorious"}, {"start": 346, "end": 356, "label": ["80488"], "title": ["Spellbound_(1945_film)"], "text": "Spellbound"}, {"start": 473, "end": 482, "label": ["62277"], "title": ["Ben_Hecht"], "text": "Ben Hecht"}, {"start": 582, "end": 597, "label": ["183740"], "title": ["Duel_in_the_Sun_(film)"], "text": "Duel in the Sun"}, {"start": 705, "end": 712, "label": ["31743"], "title": ["Uranium"], "text": "uranium"}, {"start": 837, "end": 868, "label": ["11127"], "title": ["Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation"], "text": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}, {"start": 935, "end": 944, "label": ["62277"], "title": ["Ben_Hecht"], "text": "Ben Hecht"}, {"start": 955, "end": 970, "label": ["49008"], "title": ["Robert_Andrews_Millikan"], "text": "Robert Millikan"}, {"start": 978, "end": 1012, "label": ["5786"], "title": ["California_Institute_of_Technology"], "text": "California Institute of Technology"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1214, "label": ["11778948"], "title": ["Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki"], "text": "Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1316, "label": ["2915247"], "title": ["Transatlantic_Pictures"], "text": "Transatlantic Pictures"}, {"start": 1335, "end": 1351, "label": ["8812595"], "title": ["Sidney_Bernstein,_Baron_Bernstein"], "text": "Sidney Bernstein"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1443, "label": ["23477436"], "title": ["Rope_(film)"], "text": "Rope"}, {"start": 1560, "end": 1568, "label": ["264869"], "title": ["Lifeboat_(1944_film)"], "text": "Lifeboat"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2048, "label": ["16273"], "title": ["James_Stewart"], "text": "James Stewart"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2177, "label": ["158547"], "title": ["Leopold_and_Loeb"], "text": "Leopold and Loeb"}, {"start": 2231, "end": 2246, "label": ["1584981"], "title": ["Under_Capricorn"], "text": "Under Capricorn"}, {"start": 2580, "end": 2592, "label": ["295973"], "title": ["Stage_Fright_(1950_film)"], "text": "Stage Fright"}, {"start": 2616, "end": 2623, "label": ["594188"], "title": ["Elstree_Studios"], "text": "Elstree"}]}
{"id": "16-10", "text": "He matched one of Warner Bros. ' most popular stars , Jane Wyman , with the expatriate German actor Marlene Dietrich and used several prominent British actors , including Michael Wilding , Richard Todd and Alastair Sim . This was Hitchcock 's first proper production for Warner Bros. , which had distributed Rope and Under Capricorn , because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties . His film Strangers on a Train ( 1951 ) was based on the novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith . Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films . He approached Dashiell Hammett to write the dialogue , but Raymond Chandler took over , then left over disagreements with the director . In the film , two men casually meet , one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder ; he suggests that two people , each wishing to do away with someone , should each perform the other 's murder . Farley Granger 's role was as the innocent victim of the scheme , while Robert Walker , previously known for \" boy - next - door \" roles , played the villain . I Confess ( 1953 ) was set in Quebec with Montgomery Clift as a Catholic priest . I Confess was followed by three colour films starring Grace Kelly : Dial M for Murder ( 1954 ) , Rear Window ( 1954 ) , and To Catch a Thief ( 1955 ) . In Dial M for Murder , Ray Milland plays the villain who tries to murder his unfaithful wife ( Kelly ) for her money . She kills the hired assassin in self - defence , so Milland manipulates the evidence to make it look like murder . Her lover , Mark Halliday ( Robert Cummings ) , and Police Inspector Hubbard ( John Williams ) save her from execution . Hitchcock experimented with 3D cinematography for Dial M. Hitchcock moved to Paramount Pictures and filmed Rear Window ( 1954 ) , starring James Stewart and Kelly again , as well as Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr . Stewart 's character is a photographer ( based on Robert Capa ) who must temporarily use a wheelchair . Out of boredom , he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard , then becomes convinced that one of them ( Raymond Burr ) has murdered his wife . Stewart eventually manages to convince his policeman buddy ( Wendell Corey ) and his girlfriend ( Kelly ) . As with Lifeboat and Rope , the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters , in this case Stewart 's studio apartment .

{"id": "16-11", "text": "The title - sequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of his profile ( he drew it himself ; it is composed of only nine strokes ) , which his real silhouette then filled . The series theme tune was Funeral March of a Marionette by the French composer Charles Gounod ( 1818–1893 ) . His introductions always included some sort of wry humour , such as the description of a recent multi - person execution hampered by having only one electric chair , while two are shown with a sign \" Two chairs — no waiting ! \" He directed 18 episodes of the series , which aired from 1955 to 1965 . It became The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1962 , and NBC broadcast the final episode on 10 May 1965 . In the 1980s , a new version of Alfred Hitchcock Presents was produced for television , making use of Hitchcock 's original introductions in a colourised form . In 1955 Hitchcock became a United States citizen . The same year , his third Grace Kelly film , To Catch a Thief , was released ; it is set in the French Riviera , and pairs Kelly with Cary Grant . Grant plays retired thief John Robie , who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera . A thrill - seeking American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him . \" Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot , the witty script ( loaded with double entendres ) and the good - natured acting proved a commercial success . \" It was Hitchcock 's last film with Kelly . She married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956 , and ended her film career . Hitchcock then remade his own 1934 film The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1956 . This time , the film starred James Stewart and Doris Day , who sang the theme song \" Que Sera , Sera \" , which won the Oscar for Best Original Song and became a big hit for her . They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination . As in the 1934 film , the climax takes place at the Royal Albert Hall , London . The Wrong Man ( 1957 ) , Hitchcock 's final film for Warner Bros. , is a low - key black - and - white production based on a real - life case of mistaken identity reported in Life magazine in 1953 . This was the only film of Hitchcock to star Henry Fonda , playing a Stork Club musician mistaken for a liquor store thief , who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife ( Vera Miles ) emotionally collapses under the strain . Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes . Hitchcock 's next film , Vertigo ( 1958 ) again starred James Stewart , this time with Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes . He had wanted Vera Miles to play the lead , but she was pregnant .", "entities": [{"start": 263, "end": 277, "label": ["87319"], "title": ["Charles_Gounod"], "text": "Charles Gounod"}, {"start": 443, "end": 457, "label": ["75215"], "title": ["Electric_chair"], "text": "electric chair"}, {"start": 710, "end": 721, "label": ["10943732"], "title": ["Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents_(1985_TV_series)"], "text": "new version"}, {"start": 836, "end": 846, "label": ["742784"], "title": ["Film_colorization"], "text": "colourised"}, {"start": 950, "end": 966, "label": ["239009"], "title": ["To_Catch_a_Thief"], "text": "To Catch a Thief"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1534, "label": ["154987"], "title": ["Rainier_III,_Prince_of_Monaco"], "text": "Prince Rainier"}, {"start": 1613, "end": 1622, "label": ["2345042"], "title": ["The_Man_Who_Knew_Too_Much_(1934_film)"], "text": "1934 film"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1656, "label": ["2345044"], "title": ["The_Man_Who_Knew_Too_Much_(1956_film)"], "text": "in 1956"}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1715, "label": ["8300"], "title": ["Doris_Day"], "text": "Doris Day"}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1759, "label": ["2127798"], "title": ["Que_Sera,_Sera_(Whatever_Will_Be,_Will_Be)"], "text": "Que Sera , Sera"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1806, "label": ["24128375"], "title": ["Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song"], "text": "Oscar for Best Original Song"}, {"start": 1989, "end": 2006, "label": ["179238"], "title": ["Royal_Albert_Hall"], "text": "Royal Albert Hall"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2031, "label": ["1582683"], "title": ["The_Wrong_Man"], "text": "The Wrong Man"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2272, "label": ["46228"], "title": ["Henry_Fonda"], "text": "Henry Fonda"}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2406, "label": ["884782"], "title": ["Vera_Miles"], "text": "Vera Miles"}, {"start": 2599, "end": 2606, "label": ["76617"], "title": ["Vertigo_(film)"], "text": "Vertigo"}, {"start": 2661, "end": 2670, "label": ["261259"], "title": ["Kim_Novak"], "text": "Kim Novak"}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2693, "label": ["2736686"], "title": ["Barbara_Bel_Geddes"], "text": "Barbara Bel Geddes"}, {"start": 2710, "end": 2720, "label": ["884782"], "title": ["Vera_Miles"], "text": "Vera Miles"}]}

We 'd have spent a heap of dollars on it , and she has the bad taste to get pregnant . I hate pregnant women , because then they have children . \" In the film , James Stewart plays Scottie , a former police investigator suffering from acrophobia , who develops an obsession with a woman he has been hired to shadow ( Kim Novak ) . Scottie 's obsession leads to tragedy , and this time Hitchcock does not opt for a happy ending . Some critics , including Donald Spoto and Roger Ebert , agree that Vertigo is the director 's most personal and revealing film , dealing with the Pygmalion - like obsessions of a man who crafts a woman into the woman he desires . Vertigo explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death than any other work in his filmography . Vertigo contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts , commonly referred to as a dolly zoom , that has been copied many times by filmmakers . The film premiered at the San Sebastián International Film Festival , where Hitchcock won a Silver Seashell . Vertigo is considered a classic , but it attracted some negative reviews and poor box - office receipts at the time , and it was the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock . In the 2002 Sight & Sound polls , it ranked just behind Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) ; ten years later , in the same magazine , critics chose it as the best film ever made . Hitchcock followed Vertigo with three more successful films , which are also recognised as among his best : North by Northwest ( 1959 ) , Psycho ( 1960 ) and The Birds ( 1963 ) . In North by Northwest , Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill , a Madison Avenue advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent . He is hotly pursued across the United States by enemy agents , including ( it appears ) Eve Kendall ( Eva Marie Saint ) . Thornhill at first believes Kendall is helping him , then that she is an enemy agent ; he eventually learns that she is working undercover for the CIA . During its opening two - week run at Radio City Music Hall , the film grossed $ 404,056 ( ) , setting a record in that theatre 's non - holiday gross . Time magazine called the film \" smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining \" . Psycho ( 1960 ) is arguably Hitchcock 's best - known film . Based on Robert Bloch 's novel Psycho ( 1959 ) , which was inspired by the case of Ed Gein , the film was produced on a constrained budget of $ 800,000 ( ) and shot in black - and - white on a spare set using crew members from Alfred Hitchcock Presents .", "entities": [{"start": 8, "end": 22, "label": ["141030"], "title": ["Oriana_Fallaci"], "text": "Oriana Fallaci"}, {"start": 367, "end": 377, "label": ["455905"], "title": ["Acrophobia"], "text": "acrophobia"}, {"start": 586, "end": 598, "label": ["10372027"], "title": ["Donald_Spoto"], "text": "Donald Spoto"}, {"start": 603, "end": 614, "label": ["50908"], "title": ["Roger_Ebert"], "text": "Roger Ebert"}, {"start": 707, "end": 716, "label": ["1869085"], "title": ["Pygmalion_(mythology)"], "text": "Pygmalion"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1036, "label": ["177117"], "title": ["Dolly_zoom"], "text": "dolly zoom"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1154, "label": ["7725400"], "title": ["San_Sebastián_International_Film_Festival"], "text": "San Sebastián International Film Festival"}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1406, "label": ["938514"], "title": ["Sight_&_Sound"], "text": "Sight & Sound"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1449, "label": ["5224"], "title": ["Citizen_Kane"], "text": "Citizen Kane"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1674, "label": ["73412"], "title": ["North_by_Northwest"], "text": "North by Northwest"}, {"start": 1686, "end": 1692, "label": ["23880"], "title": ["Psycho_(1960_film)"], "text": "Psycho"}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1715, "label": ["304428"], "title": ["The_Birds_(film)"], "text": "The Birds"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1993, "label": ["216314"], "title": ["Eva_Marie_Saint"], "text": "Eva Marie Saint"}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2209, "label": ["170810"], "title": ["Radio_City_Music_Hall"], "text": "Radio City Music Hall"}, {"start": 2303, "end": 2307, "label": ["31600"], "title": ["Time_(magazine)"], "text": "Time"}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2391, "label": ["23880"], "title": ["Psycho_(1960_film)"], "text": "Psycho"}, {"start": 2455, "end": 2467, "label": ["26243"], "title": ["Robert_Bloch"], "text": "Robert Bloch"}, {"start": 2477, "end": 2483, "label": ["5359189"], "title": ["Psycho_(novel)"], "text": "Psycho"}, {"start": 2529, "end": 2536, "label": ["71376"], "title": ["Ed_Gein"], "text": "Ed Gein"}, {"start": 2673, "end": 2698, "label": ["247610"], "title": ["Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents"], "text": "Alfred Hitchcock Presents"}]}
